                "value": "2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Unaudited Interim Financial Statements The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. Beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2015, we changed the composition of the revenue and cost of revenue lines in our consolidated statement of operations. Automotive includes revenues related to deliveries of new Model S vehicles, including customer selected options, data connectivity, Supercharger access, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees, and Model S leasing revenue. Services and other consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance and development services, Tesla Energy products, and pre-owned Tesla vehicle sales. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency. This change was based on the culmination of facts and circumstances that have developed as we expanded our foreign operations over the past year. The adjustment of $10.0 million attributable to the current rate translation of non-monetary assets as of the date of the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues from sales of Model S, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with Autopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of June 30, 2015, we had deferred $47.8 million, $34.6 million, $21.0 million, and $4.9 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, Model S connectivity, and Autopilot software upgrades. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $39.7 million, $25.6 million, $14.4 million, and $1.5 million related to these same performance obligations. Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase a Model S in the US, Canada and selected European and Asian markets and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive revenue. The amount of proceeds related to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the option expires or is exercised. We capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period. At the end of the resale value guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and any remaining deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue if our customer retains ownership of the car. In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we purchase the car in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive revenue. As of June 30, 2015, $67.7 million of the resale value guarantee liability relates to guarantees that are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $179.3 million and $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee and $40.7 million and $0 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the bank leasing partner should we repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the bank sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at June 30, 2015, is $131.6 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Account activity related to our resale value guarantee program consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30, 2015\nJune 30, 2015\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nOperating lease vehicles under the resale value guarantee program—beginning of period\n$\n792,711\n$\n684,590\nNet increase in operating lease vehicles under the resale value guarantee program\n208,399\n348,192\nDepreciation expense recorded in cost of automotive revenues\n(26,951\n)\n(48,993\n)\nAdditional depreciation expense recorded in cost of automotive revenues as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(5,058\n)\n(9,455\n)\nReclassifications to inventory resulting from return of vehicle under trade-in program\n(6,364\n)\n(11,597\n)\nOperating lease vehicles under the resale value guarantee program—end of period\n$\n962,737\n$\n962,737\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue related to the resale value guarantee program—beginning of period\n$\n424,104\n$\n381,096\nNet increase in deferred revenue including Model S deliveries with resale value guarantee and reclassification of collateralized borrowing from long-term to short-term\n118,648\n210,388\nAmortization of deferred revenue and short-term collateralized borrowing recorded in automotive revenue\n(54,175\n)\n(98,924\n)\nAdditional revenue recorded in automotive revenue as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(3,310\n)\n(4,496\n)\nRelease of deferred revenue resulting from return of vehicle under trade-in program\n(2,695\n)\n(5,492\n)\nDeferred revenue related to the resale value guarantee program—end of period\n$\n482,572\n$\n482,572\nResale Value Guarantee\nResale value guarantee liability—beginning of period\n$\n606,221\n$\n487,879\nNet increase in resale value guarantee\n198,290\n322,402\nReclassification from long-term to short-term collateralized borrowing\n(3,743\n)\n(4,387\n)\nAdditional revenue recorded in automotive revenue as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(2,966\n)\n(4,036\n)\nRelease of resale value guarantee resulting from return of vehicle under trade-in program\n(4,625\n)\n(8,681\n)\nResale value guarantee liability—end of period\n$\n793,177\n$\n793,177\nModel S Leasing Program We offer a leasing program in the United States and Canada for Model S. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S directly from Tesla for 36 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had deferred $19.6 million and $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $9.3 million and $15.9 million. Lease revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 was $0.2 million. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves upon delivery to the customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\n$\n155,301\n$\n71,932\n$\n129,043\n$\n53,183\nWarranty costs incurred\n(17,287\n)\n(9,271\n)\n(29,073\n)\n(18,571\n)\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations\n567\n1,541\n11,329\n9,661\nProvision for warranty\n26,014\n20,169\n53,296\n40,098\nAccrued warranty—end of period\n$\n164,595\n$\n84,371\n$\n164,595\n$\n84,371\nOur warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our operating lease vehicles and vehicles sold with resale value guarantee or similar buy-back terms as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, warranty costs incurred for our operating lease vehicles were $2.4 million and $4.2 million and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were $1.8 million and $3.0 million. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue. Cost of automotive revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2015 included a $11.3 million increase to our warranty reserve to reflect the additional preventative repairs we plan to perform on customer drive units and high-voltage battery packs when brought in for warranty related service. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs when we have amounts of inventory that are in excess of our planned production or where inventory has become obsolete to our production requirements. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. A change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high credit quality securities based on our investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss of capital. Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include U.S. treasury bills. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from amounts to be received from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory credits, as well as the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As of June 30, 2015, we have two customers who individually account for 11% and 10% of our accounts receivable. Supply Risk Although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the service period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Net Loss per Share of Common Stock Our basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as our convertible senior notes, are not included when their effect is antidilutive. The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented. Anti-dilutive share counts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 have been updated.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\n2014\nEmployee share based awards\n14,339,572\n13,883,882\n14,396,259\n14,124,057\n14,729,749\nConvertible senior notes\n2,517,573\n2,145,517\n2,301,823\n2,082,759\n2,344,998\nWarrants issued May 2013\n1,177,659\n626,447\n858,019\n533,469\n921,985\nSince we expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52, $359.87 and $359.87 per share for the convertible senior notes due 2018 (2018 Notes), convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes), and convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes). Uncertain Tax Positions As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $57.1 million and $41.4 million. $54.1 million and $39.1 million of these aggregate balances would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset by a full valuation allowance.

                "value": "4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets that are carried at fair value was as follows (in thousands), and unrealized gains (losses) on all financial assets for all periods presented were less than $1.0 million:\nJune 30, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nFair Value\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nFair Value\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel\nMoney market funds\n$\n349,556\n$\n349,556\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n1,275,346\n$\n1,275,346\n$\n—\n$\n—\nU.S. treasury bills\n16,662\n16,662\n—\n—\n16,673\n16,673\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n366,218\n$\n366,218\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n1,292,019\n$\n1,292,019\n$\n—\n$\n—\nAs of June 30, 2015, the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes was $1.44 billion (par value $659.8 million), $908.5 million (par value $920.0 million), and $1.36 billion (par value $1.38 billion). As of December 31, 2014 the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes was $1.22 billion (par value $659.8 million), $852.2 million (par value $920.0 million), and $1.25 billion (par value $1.38 billion). These fair values represent Level II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk. As of June 30, 2015, the $114.3 million carrying value of our Warehouse Facility liability and $50 million carrying value of our Asset Backed Credit Facility approximates the fair value of these borrowings.

                "value": "6. Convertible and Long-term Debt Obligations 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes will initially be convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from the 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million, of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes to convert have been met as of June 30, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the third quarter of 2015 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the third quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in connection with 2018 Notes which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of 2018 Notes. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes will initially be convertible into 8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The interest under 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payment upon the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the third quarter of 2015. As such, we classified the $609.5 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $50.3 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other current assets as of June 30, 2015. Should the closing price conditions be met again in the third quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. Convertible Senior Notes Carrying Value and Interest Expense In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option for the 2018, 2019, and 2021 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at the effective interest rate over the contractual terms of the Notes.\nJune 30, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\n2018 Notes\n2019 Notes\n2021 Notes\n2018 Notes\n2019 Notes\n2021 Notes\n(in thousands, except years and percentages)\nCarrying value\n$\n609,489\n$\n777,287\n$\n1,069,159\n$\n601,566\n$\n759,891\n$\n1,046,627\nUnamortized discount\n50,273\n142,713\n310,841\n58,196\n160,109\n333,373\nPrincipal amount\n$\n659,762\n$\n920,000\n$\n1,380,000\n$\n659,762\n$\n920,000\n$\n1,380,000\nRemaining amortization period (years)\n2.7\n3.4\n5.4\nEffective interest rate on liability component\n4.29\n%\n4.89\n%\n5.96\n%\nCarrying amount of equity component\n$\n82,800\n$\n188,100\n$\n369,400\nIf converted value in excess of par value\n$\n761,575\n$\n—\n$\n—\nWarehouse line of credit In March 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Warehouse Facility”) for a secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $100 million. In June 2015, we amended the Warehouse Facility for an additional principal amount of $50 million, for a total of up to $150 million. Obligations under the Warehouse Facility are secured by certain of our lease contracts with Tesla directly and the related leased vehicles. In connection with the Warehouse Facility, we sold the beneficial interest in such lease contracts and related vehicles to a wholly owned special purpose entity that is the borrower in the Warehouse Facility, which pledged such beneficial interest in the underlying assets to the third-party lender under the Warehouse Facility. Borrowings under the Warehouse Facility are generally limited to up to 72% of the net present value of the remaining lease payments and the residual vehicle values under eligible lease contracts. As of June 30, 2015, we have borrowed $114.3 million under the Warehouse Facility. Interest is payable monthly on amounts borrowed under the Warehouse Facility at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.5%. The Warehouse facility matures in March 2017, at which time all outstanding borrowing will become due. Prior to that date, principal payments will be due in the amount that the borrowing limit decreases below our outstanding principal balance. We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements for our borrowings. As of June 30, 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Warehouse Facility agreement. Asset-Based Credit Agreement In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million (the “Credit Facility”), which we may draw upon as needed. We may increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to certain conditions, for total commitments up to $750 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million swing-line loan sub-facility. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by a pledge of certain of our accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates, and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020. As of June 30, 2015, we have borrowed $50.0 million under the Credit Facility. We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements for our borrowings. As of June 30, 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.

In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint, made claims against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney’s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla’s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013.

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. Beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2015, we changed the composition of the revenue and cost of revenue lines in our consolidated statement of operations. Automotive includes revenues related to deliveries of new Model S vehicles, including customer selected options, data connectivity, Supercharger access, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees, and Model S leasing revenue. Services and other consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance and development services, Tesla Energy products, and pre-owned Tesla vehicle sales. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency.

The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. ",

            "Revenue Recognition": {
                "value": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues from sales of Model S, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with Autopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of June 30, 2015, we had deferred $47.8 million, $34.6 million, $21.0 million, and $4.9 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, Model S connectivity, and Autopilot software upgrades. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $39.7 million, $25.6 million, $14.4 million, and $1.5 million related to these same performance obligations. Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase a Model S in the US, Canada and selected European and Asian markets and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive revenue. The amount of proceeds related to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the option expires or is exercised. We capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period. At the end of the resale value guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and any remaining deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue if our customer retains ownership of the car. In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we purchase the car in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive revenue. As of June 30, 2015, $67.7 million of the resale value guarantee liability relates to guarantees that are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $179.3 million and $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee and $40.7 million and $0 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the bank leasing partner should we repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the bank sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at June 30, 2015, is $131.6 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

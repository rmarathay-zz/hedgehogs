                "value": "Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Unaudited Interim Financial Statements The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as other information disclosed in the accompanying notes, are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future years or interim periods. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, we have reclassified the revenue and cost of revenue of our energy storage products from ‘services and other’ into ‘energy generation and storage’ for all periods presented. Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee We offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive leasing revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $197.3 million and $179.5 million, respectively, of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue . The maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $977.4 million as of March 31, 2017, including . As of March 1.18 billion 289.1 . As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had a total of $50.3 million and $57.0 million, respectively, in account receivables from our leasing partners On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2016\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nOperating lease vehicles—beginning of period\n$\n2,462,061\n$\n1,556,529\nNet increase in operating lease vehicles\n414,361\n413,981\nDepreciation expense recorded in cost of automotive leasing revenues\n(78,856\n)\n(44,818\n)\nAdditional depreciation expense recorded in cost of automotive leasing revenues as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(8,423\n)\n(3,086\n)\nAdditional depreciation expense recorded in cost of automotive leasing revenues result of expiration\n(41,432\n)\n—\nIncreases to inventory from vehicles returned under our trade- in program and exercises of resale value guarantee\n(15,312\n)\n(13,296\n)\nOperating lease vehicles—end of period\n$\n2,732,399\n$\n1,909,310\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue—beginning of period\n$\n916,652\n$\n679,132\nNet increase in deferred revenue from new vehicle deliveries and reclassification of collateralized borrowing from long-term to short-term\n238,687\n225,764\nAmortization of deferred revenue and short-term collateralized borrowing recorded in automotive leasing revenue\n(137,668\n)\n(97,748\n)\nAdditional revenue recorded in automotive leasing revenue as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(1,737\n)\n(2,996\n)\nRecognition of deferred revenue resulting from return of vehicle under trade-in program, expiration, and exercises of resale value guarantee\n(5,432\n)\n(3,184\n)\nDeferred revenue—end of period\n$\n1,010,502\n$\n800,968\nResale Value Guarantee\nResale value guarantee liability—beginning of period\n$\n2,389,927\n$\n1,430,573\nIncrease in resale value guarantee\n418,721\n381,499\nReclassification from long-term to short-term collateralized borrowing\n(48,384\n)\n(22,826\n)\nAdditional revenue recorded in automotive leasing revenue as a result of early cancellation of resale value guarantee\n(6,142\n)\n(2,501\n)\nRelease of resale value guarantee resulting from return of vehicle under trade-in program and exercises\n(20,199\n)\n(11,247\n)\nRelease of resale value guarantee resulting from expiration of resale value guarantee\n(41,330\n)\n—\nResale value guarantee liability—end of period\n$\n2,692,593\n$\n1,775,498\nIncome Taxes There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $219.4 million and $203.9 million, respectively, of which $213.2 million and $198.3 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. Net Loss per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Since we expect to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018, the 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any. The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2016\nStock-based awards\n9,738,595\n16,267,953\nConvertible senior notes\n2,370,788\n1,955,136\nWarrants\n595,104\n344,392\nConcentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits may be in excess of insured limits. As of March 31, 2017, no customer represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational banks. We maintain reserves for any amounts that we consider uncollectible. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and certified pre-owned vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or power purchase agreements, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2016\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\n$\n266,655\n$\n180,754\nWarranty costs incurred\n(23,016\n)\n(15,704\n)\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact\n(3,510\n)\n3,384\nProvision for warranty\n66,822\n30,271\nAccrued warranty—end of period\n$\n306,951\n$\n198,705\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements were $6.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively.

                "value": "Note 3 – Business Combinations Grohmann Acquisition On January 3, 2017 we completed our acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH (“Grohmann”), a company that specializes in the design, development and sale of automated manufacturing systems, for $109.5 million in cash. We acquired Grohmann to improve the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing processes. At the time of acquisition, we entered into an incentive compensation arrangement for up to a maximum of $25.8 million of payments contingent upon continued service with us for 36 months after the acquisition date. Such payments would have been accounted for as compensation expense in the periods earned. However, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we terminated the incentive compensation arrangement and accelerated the payments thereunder. As a result, we recorded the entire $25.8 million as compensation expense during this period, which was included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed We accounted for the Grohmann acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations As we finalize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price adjustments may be recorded during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months). Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results of operations. Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates. The finalization of the purchase accounting assessment may result in a change in the valuation of the intangible assets acquired and the related taxes, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as follows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n334\nAccounts receivable\n42,947\nInventory\n10,031\nProperty, plant and equipment\n44,030\nIntangible assets\n21,723\nPrepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current\n1,998\nTotal assets acquired\n$\n121,063\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable\n(19,975\n)\nAccrued liabilities\n(12,403\n)\nDebt and capital leases, current and non-current\n(9,220\n)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(10,049\n)\nTotal liabilities assumed\n$\n(51,647\n)\nNet assets acquired\n$\n69,416\nGoodwill\n40,065\nTotal purchase price\n$\n109,481\nGoodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating Grohmann’s technology into our automotive business as well as the acquired talent. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes and is not amortized. Rather, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired A preliminary assessment of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives are as follows (in thousands, except for estimated useful life):\nAs of March 31, 2017\nApproximate Fair Value\nEstimated Useful Life (in years)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n12,528\n10\nSoftware\n3,341\n3\nCustomer relations\n3,236\n6\nTrade name\n1,775\n7\nOther\n843\n2\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n21,723\nGrohmann’s results of operations since the acquisition date have been included within the automotive segment in our consolidated statements of operations.

If the research and development efforts are successfully completed and commercial feasibility is reached, the IPR&D would be amortized over its then estimated useful life. If the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned, the IPR&D might be impaired. The fair value of the IPR&D was estimated using the replacement cost method under the cost approach, based on the historical acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for estimated developer’s profit, opportunity cost and obsolescence factor. We expect to complete the research and development efforts in the second half of 2017, but there can be no assurance that the commercial feasibility will be achieved. The nature of the research and development efforts consists principally of planning, designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing. If commercial feasibility is not achieved, we would likely look to other alternative technologies.

The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy. Interest Rate Swaps We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as required by certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other long-term liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

See below and Note 16, Related Party Transactions Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. The following descriptions summarize the significant debt activity in the three months ended March 31, 2017. 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions In March 2017, we issued $977.5 million in aggregate principal of 2.375% convertible senior notes due in March 2022 (“2022 Notes”) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $965.9 million. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is initially convertible into 3.0534 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $327.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert such 2022 Notes, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing price of our common stock for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period; or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, we would pay cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of March In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $145.6 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $52.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017. Term Loan due in December 2018 On March 31, 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement for a term loan. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate of the lender’s cost of funds plus 3.25%. The fee for undrawn commitments is 0.85% per annum. On March 31, 2017, the agreement was amended to extend the availability period and the maturity date. The term loan is secured by substantially all of the assets and cash flows of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to our other assets. Term Loan due in January 2021 In January 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks for a term loan. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%. The term loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary, including its interests in certain financing funds, and is non-recourse to our other assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repaid $2.3 million of the principal outstanding under the term loan. MyPower Revolving Credit Facility In January 2017, the MyPower revolving credit facility matured, and the aggregate outstanding principal amount was fully repaid. Solar Renewable Energy Credit Loan Facilities On March 31, 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement for a term loan. The term loan bore interest at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 9.00% or, at our option, 8.00% plus the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The term loan was secured by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary, including its rights under forward contracts to sell solar renewable energy credits, and was non-recourse to our other assets. On March 1, 2017, we fully repaid the outstanding principal amount under the term loan. On July 14, 2016, the same subsidiary entered into an agreement for another loan facility. The loan facility bears interest at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 5.75% or, at our option, 4.75% plus the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary, including its rights under forward contracts to sell solar renewable energy credits, and is non-recourse to our other assets. Solar Loan-backed Notes, Series 2017-A On January 27, 2017, we pooled and transferred certain MyPower customer notes receivable into a special purpose entity (“SPE”) and issued $123.0 million in aggregate principal of Solar Loan-backed Notes, Series 2017-A, Class A; $8.8 million in aggregate principal of Solar Loan-backed Notes, Series 2017-A, Class B; and $13.2 million in aggregate principal of Solar Loan-backed Notes, Series 2017-A, Class C; backed by these notes receivable to investors. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in our financial statements. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of these notes receivable. The Solar Loan-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 1.87% for Class A, 1.86% for Class B and 8.13% for Class C. The payments received by the SPE from these notes receivable are used to service the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the Solar Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The SPE’s assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Solar Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Interest Expense The following table presents the aggregate amount of interest expense recognized relating to the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt issuance costs and debt discount on convertible notes with cash conversion features, which includes the 2018 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2016\nContractual interest coupon\n$\n6,151\n$\n8,391\nAmortization of debt issuance costs\n1,308\n1,898\nAmortization of debt discount\n23,962\n25,191\nTotal\n$\n31,421\n$\n35,480",

                "value": "Note 13 – Equity Incentive Plans In 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2010 Plan may be either incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees, including officers and directors. Nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and consultants. Generally, our stock option and RSU awards vest over up to four years and are exercisable over a maximum period of ten years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity, we assumed its equity award plans and its outstanding equity awards as of the acquisition date. The assumed equity awards were converted into equity awards of Tesla common stock in share amounts and prices based on the exchange ratio specified in the acquisition agreement, with the assumed equity awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. The assumed equity awards have vesting and other terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those under the 2010 Plan. As of March 31, 2017, there were 16,856,143 shares underlying outstanding equity awards. 2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares of our common stock. Each award consisted of four vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:\n•\n1/4th of each award vested upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle;\n•\n1/4th of each award is scheduled to vest upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;\n•\n1/4th of each award is scheduled to vest upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and\n•\n1/4th of each award is scheduled to vest upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30.0% for any three-year period. As of March 31, 2017, the following performance milestone was achieved:\n•\nCompletion of the first Model X production vehicle. As of March 31, 2017, the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement:\n•\nCompletion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and\n•\nAchieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period. We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of March 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $17.1 million for the performance milestone that was not considered probable of achievement. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to these awards. 2012 Chief Executive Officer Awards In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to our Chief Executive Officer (the “2012 CEO Grant”). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to our initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant. As of March 31, 2017, the market conditions for eight vesting tranches and the following seven performance milestones were achieved:\n•\nSuccessful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;\n•\nSuccessful completion of the Model X beta prototype;\n•\nCompletion of the first Model X production vehicle;\n•\nAggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;\n•\nSuccessful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype,\n•\nSuccessful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype; and\n•\nAggregate production of 200,000 vehicles. As of March 31, 2017, the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement:\n•\nCompletion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and\n•\nAggregate production of 300,000 vehicles. We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of March 31, 2017, we had $3.5 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for those performance milestones that were considered probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. As of March 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million for the performance milestone that was not considered probable of achievement. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million and $10.4 million, respectively, related to the 2012 CEO Grant. Our Chief Executive Officer earns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not accept his salary.

Build-to-Suit Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York As discussed in Note 8, Property, Plant and Equipment , Under the terms of the build-to-suit lease arrangement, we are required to achieve specific operational milestones during the initial term of the lease, which include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, within western New York and within the State of New York within specified periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also required to spend or incur approximately $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other costs in the State of New York over the 10 years following the achievement of full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing facility, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41.2 million “program payment” to the Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts might be payable by us. The non-cash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement during the three months ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $40.9 million. Legal Proceedings Securities Litigation On March 28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities from March 6, 2013 to March 18, 2014. After a series of amendments to the original complaint, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in SolarCity’s favor on August 9, 2016. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. On August 15, 2016, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity, two of its officers and a former officer. On March 20, 2017, the purported stockholder class filed a consolidated complaint that includes the original matter in the same court against SolarCity, one of its officers and three former officers. As consolidated, the complaint alleges that SolarCity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made. The plaintiffs claim violations of federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities from May 6, 2015 to May 9, 2016. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint; that motion is pending. These same plaintiffs filed a parallel action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21, 2017, adding claims for violations of the federal securities laws. On February 6, 2017, a purported stockholder made a demand to inspect Tesla’s books and records, purportedly to investigate potential breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the SolarCity acquisition. On April 17, 2017, the purported stockholder filed a petition for a writ of mandate in California Superior Court, seeking to compel Tesla to provide the documents requested in the demand. On March 24, 2017, another lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by a purported Tesla stockholder challenging the SolarCity acquisition. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Tesla’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and alleges violations of the federal securities laws. Tesla believes that claims challenging the SolarCity merger are without merit. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with these claims. Proceedings Relating to United States Treasury In July 2012, SolarCity, along with other companies in the solar energy industry, received a subpoena from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCity’s possession that were dated, created, revised or referred to after January 1, 2007 and that relate to SolarCity’s applications for U.S. Treasury grants or communications with certain other solar energy development companies or with certain firms that appraise solar energy property for U.S Treasury grant application purposes. The Inspector General and the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating the administration and implementation of the U.S Treasury grant program relating to the fair market value of the solar energy systems that SolarCity submitted in U.S. Treasury grant applications. SolarCity has accrued a reserve for its potential liability associated with this ongoing investigation as of December 31, 2016. In February 2013, two of SolarCity’s financing funds filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States government, seeking to recover approximately $14.0 million that the United States Treasury was obligated to pay, but failed to pay, under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In February 2016, the U.S. government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the U.S. government, in fact, paid them more, not less, than they were entitled to as a matter of law. We believe that the U.S. government’s claims are without merit and expect the plaintiff funds to litigate the case vigorously. Trial in the case is set for the latter half of 2017. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. Other Matters From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. Indemnifications and Guaranteed Returns As disclosed in Note 15, VIE Arrangements , The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the U.S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants. We claim U.S. Treasury grants based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine future revisions to U.S. Treasury Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date. We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received. As disclosed in Note 15, we are contractually required to make payments to one fund investor to ensure that the fund investor achieves a specified minimum internal rate of return. The fund investor has already received a significant portion of the projected economic benefits from U.S. Treasury grant distributions and tax depreciation benefits. The contractual provisions of the fund state that the fund has an indefinite term unless the members agree to dissolve the fund. Based on our current financial projections regarding the amount and timing of future distributions to the fund investor, we do not expect to make any payments as a result of this guarantee and has not accrued any liabilities for this guarantee. The amount of potential future payments under this guarantee is dependent on the amount and timing of future distributions to the fund investor and future tax benefits that accrue to the fund investor. Due to the uncertainties surrounding estimating the amounts of these factors, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential payments under this guarantee. To date, the fund investor has achieved the specified minimum internal rate of return as determined in accordance with the contractual provisions of the fund. Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation. Letters of Credit As of March 31, 2017, we had $86.0 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.",

                "value": "Note 15 – VIE Arrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in contractual agreements. Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the contractual agreements. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were contractually required to make payments to a fund investor in order to ensure the investor is projected to achieve a specified minimum return annually. The amounts of any potential future payments under this guarantee are dependent on the amounts and timing of future distributions to the fund investor from the fund, the tax benefits that accrue to the fund investor from the fund’s activities and the amount and timing of our purchase of the fund investor’s interest in the fund or the amount and timing of the distributions to the fund investor upon liquidation of the fund. Due to uncertainties associated with estimating the amount and timing of distributions to the fund investor and the possibility and timing of liquidation of the fund, we are unable to determine the potential maximum future payments that we would have to make under this guarantee. Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the contractual agreements. Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the contractual agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations.

In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $197.3 million and $179.5 million, respectively, of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue .

At times, these deposits may be in excess of insured limits. As of March 31, 2017, no customer represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational banks. We maintain reserves for any amounts that we consider uncollectible. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.",

In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or power purchase agreements, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities.

                "value": "Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements Unaudited Interim Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015, the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. Beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2015, we changed the composition of the revenue and cost of revenue lines in our consolidated statement of operations. Automotive revenues includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, including customer selected options, data connectivity, Supercharger access, vehicle software upgrades, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees, and vehicle leasing revenue. Services and other revenues consists of vehicle service income, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance and development services income, Tesla Energy product sales, and pre-owned Tesla vehicle sales. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency. This change was based on the culmination of facts and circumstances that have developed as we expanded our foreign operations over the past year. The adjustment of $10.0 million attributable to the current rate translation of non-monetary assets as of the date of the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a new model to determine when and over what period revenue is recognized. Under this new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Vehicle sales include certain standard features, customer selected options and accessories and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including internet connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network, and future over the air software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the life of the car. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of September 30, 2015, we had deferred $50.3 million, $40.1 million, $23.4 million, and $11.6 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, and future software upgrades. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $39.7 million, $25.6 million, $14.4 million, and $1.5 million related to these same performance obligations. Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles in the US, Canada, European and Asian markets and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a pre-determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we account for these sales as operating leases and recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive revenue. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the stated guarantee period or the pay-off date of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period. In cases when a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue. In cases when a customer returns the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive revenue. As of September 30, 2015, $85.6 million of the resale value guarantee liability relates to guarantees that are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for receipt of cash from our bank leasing partners as collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $321.7 million and $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee and $73.9 million and $0 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the bank leasing partner should we repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the bank sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at September 30, 2015, is $210.0 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S directly from Tesla for 36 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had deferred $22.6 million and $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $11.5 million and $27.4 million. Lease revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 was $1.1 million and $1.3 million. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems, and Tesla Energy products we sell. We accrue a manufacturer’s warranty reserve which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\n$\n164,595\n$\n84,371\n$\n129,043\n$\n53,183\nWarranty costs incurred\n(21,593\n)\n(11,179\n)\n(50,666\n)\n(29,750\n)\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations\n1,306\n14,609\n12,635\n24,270\nProvision for warranty\n26,026\n25,934\n79,322\n66,032\nAccrued warranty—end of period\n$\n170,334\n$\n113,735\n$\n170,334\n$\n113,735\nOur warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements. Costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements were $1.8 million and $6.0 million, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, costs were $2.1 million and $5.1 million. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue. Cost of automotive revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $12.6 million increase to our warranty reserve to reflect the additional preventative repairs we plan to perform on customer drive units and high-voltage battery packs when brought in for warranty related service. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs when we have amounts of inventory that are in excess of our planned production or where inventory has become obsolete to our production requirements. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. A change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high credit quality securities based on our investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss of capital. Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include U.S. treasury bills. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from amounts to be received from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory credits, as well as the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As of September 30, 2015, we have two customers who individually account for 10% and 9% of our accounts receivable. Supply Risk Although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the service period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Net Loss per Share of Common Stock Our basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as our convertible senior notes, are not included when their effect is antidilutive. The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented. Anti-dilutive share counts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 have been updated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\n2014\nEmployee share based awards\n14,917,083\n13,852,307\n15,426,144\n14,048,245\n14,729,749\nConvertible senior notes\n2,710,738\n2,633,925\n2,454,778\n2,294,291\n2,344,998\nWarrants issued May 2013\n1,463,838\n1,350,038\n1,084,627\n846,860\n921,985\nSince we expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52, $359.87 and $359.87 per share for the convertible senior notes due 2018 (2018 Notes), convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes), and convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes). Income Taxes There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $64.0 million and $41.4 million. $60.8 million and $39.1 million of these aggregate balances would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset by a full valuation allowance.

                "value": "Note 3 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.

In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes will initially be convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from the 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million, of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes to convert have been met as of September 30, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the fourth quarter of 2015 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the fourth quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in connection with 2018 Notes which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of 2018 Notes. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes will initially be convertible into 8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The interest under 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payment upon the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the fourth quarter of 2015. As such, we classified the $613.6 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $46.2 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other current assets as of September 30, 2015. Should the closing price conditions be met again in the fourth quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. Convertible Senior Notes Carrying Value and Interest Expense In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option for the 2018, 2019, and 2021 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at the effective interest rate over the contractual terms of the Notes.\nSeptember 30, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\n2018 Notes\n2019 Notes\n2021 Notes\n2018 Notes\n2019 Notes\n2021 Notes\n(in thousands, except years and percentages)\nCarrying value\n$\n613,581\n$\n786,290\n$\n1,080,865\n$\n601,566\n$\n759,891\n$\n1,046,627\nUnamortized discount\n46,181\n133,710\n299,135\n58,196\n160,109\n333,373\nPrincipal amount\n$\n659,762\n$\n920,000\n$\n1,380,000\n$\n659,762\n$\n920,000\n$\n1,380,000\nRemaining amortization period (years)\n2.4\n3.2\n5.2\nEffective interest rate on liability component\n4.29\n%\n4.89\n%\n5.96\n%\nCarrying amount of equity component\n$\n82,800\n$\n188,100\n$\n369,400\nIf converted value in excess of par value\n$\n656,352\nWarehouse line of credit In March 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Warehouse Facility”) for a secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $100 million. In June 2015, we amended the Warehouse Facility for an additional principal amount of $50 million, for a total of up to $150 million. Obligations under the Warehouse Facility are secured by certain of our lease contracts with Tesla directly and the related leased vehicles. In connection with the Warehouse Facility, we sold the beneficial interest in such lease contracts and related vehicles to a wholly owned special purpose entity that is the borrower in the Warehouse Facility, which pledged such beneficial interest in the underlying assets to the third-party lender under the Warehouse Facility. Borrowings under the Warehouse Facility are generally limited to up to 72% of the net present value of the remaining lease payments and the residual vehicle values under eligible lease contracts. As of September 30, 2015, we have borrowed $124.4 million under the Warehouse Facility. Interest is payable monthly on amounts borrowed under the Warehouse Facility at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.5%. The Warehouse facility matures in March 2017, at which time all outstanding borrowing will become due. Prior to that date, principal payments will be due in the amount that the borrowing limit decreases below our outstanding principal balance. We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements for our borrowings. As of September 30, 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Warehouse Facility agreement. Asset-Based Credit Agreement In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks, which we amended as of November 3, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which we may draw upon as needed. In October, lenders increased their total funding commitments to us under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to certain conditions, for total commitments up to $750 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million swing-line loan sub-facility. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by a pledge of certain of our accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates, and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020. As of September 30, 2015, we had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements for our borrowings. As of September 30, 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. Pledged Assets As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we have pledged or restricted $1,465 million and $29.3 million principally from finished goods and raw materials inventory, as well as certain property and equipment, direct lease vehicles, receivables and cash as collateral for letters of credit including our Warehouse line of credit and our Asset-based credit arrangement, real estate leases, and insurance policies.

In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint, made claims against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney’s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla’s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and thereafter issued a formal written order to that effect. The plaintiffs have appealed from the trial court’s order, and that appeal is pending. ",

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. Beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2015, we changed the composition of the revenue and cost of revenue lines in our consolidated statement of operations. Automotive revenues includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, including customer selected options, data connectivity, Supercharger access, vehicle software upgrades, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees, and vehicle leasing revenue. Services and other revenues consists of vehicle service income, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance and development services income, Tesla Energy product sales, and pre-owned Tesla vehicle sales. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency.

The new guidance provides a new model to determine when and over what period revenue is recognized. Under this new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.

                "value": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Vehicle sales include certain standard features, customer selected options and accessories and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including internet connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network, and future over the air software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the life of the car. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of September 30, 2015, we had deferred $50.3 million, $40.1 million, $23.4 million, and $11.6 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, and future software upgrades. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $39.7 million, $25.6 million, $14.4 million, and $1.5 million related to these same performance obligations. Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles in the US, Canada, European and Asian markets and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a pre-determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we account for these sales as operating leases and recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive revenue. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the stated guarantee period or the pay-off date of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period. In cases when a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue. In cases when a customer returns the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive revenue. As of September 30, 2015, $85.6 million of the resale value guarantee liability relates to guarantees that are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for receipt of cash from our bank leasing partners as collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $321.7 million and $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee and $73.9 million and $0 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the bank leasing partner should we repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the bank sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at September 30, 2015, is $210.0 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include U.S. treasury bills. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from amounts to be received from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory credits, as well as the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

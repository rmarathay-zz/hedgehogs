                "value": "Basis of Presentation: The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company and include the accounts of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (\"Advance\"), its wholly owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (\"Advance Stores\"), and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company, the results of its operations and cash flows have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted based upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") interim reporting guidance. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2015 (filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016 ). The accounting policies followed in the presentation of interim financial results are consistent with those followed on an annual basis. These policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The first quarter of each of the Company's fiscal years contains 16 weeks. The Company's remaining three quarters consist of 12 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Segment and Related Information Effective in the second quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its five geographic areas which included the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names into three geographic divisions. As a result of this realignment the Company has reduced its number of operating segments from six to four. Each of the Advance Auto Parts geographic divisions, in addition to Worldpac, are individually considered operating segments which continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-3 \"Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\" effective January 3, 2016, or the beginning of fiscal 2016. ASU 2015-3 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring such costs be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. Concurrently, the Company also adopted ASU 2015-15 \"Interest - Imputed Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\" which clarifies that entities may continue to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The adoption of these ASU's have been retrospectively applied and resulted in a reclassification of $6,864 of debt issuance costs from Other assets, net to Long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2014-12 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period\" effective the beginning of fiscal 2016. The amendments in this ASU require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The adoption of this standard did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Company's policies were already consistent with the new guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\" related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The pronouncement provides clarification guidance on eight specific cash flow presentation issues that have developed due to diversity in practice. The issues include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and cash receipts from payments on beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which requires businesses to present financial assets, measured at an amortized cost basis, at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables. The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" aimed at simplifying certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. The areas for simplification include the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The standard will be applied both prospectively and retrospectively depending on the provision. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" This ASU is a comprehensive new lease standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. It will require companies to recognize lease assets, and lease liabilities by lessees, for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous lease guidance. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; earlier adoption is permitted. In the financial statements in which the ASU is first applied, leases shall be measured and recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented with an adjustment to equity. Practical expedients are available for election as a package and if applied consistently to all leases. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows but believes the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the consolidated balance sheets. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 \"Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" Although the ASU retains many of the current requirements for financial instruments, it significantly revises an entity’s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\" ASU 2015-11 requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, simplifying the current requirement that inventories be measured at the lower of cost or market. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured using the last-in, first-out method or retail inventory method. The guidance will be effective prospectively for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2016; earlier adoption is permitted. As the majority of the Company's inventory is accounted for under the last-in, first-out method, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\" This new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" This ASU, along with subsequent ASU's issued to clarify certain provisions of ASU 2014-09, provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that expands disclosure requirements and requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will become effective during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year of adoption with public entities permitted to early adopt for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities may choose from two transition methods, with certain practical expedients, a full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of this standard on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which method of adoption is most appropriate for the Company.",

The Company used the LIFO method of accounting for approximately 88% and 89% of inventories at October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016 , respectively. Under LIFO, the Company’s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories, while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs for inventories purchased in Fiscal 2016 and prior years. As a result of changes in the LIFO reserve, the Company recorded a reduction to cost of sales of $48,675 and $46,356 for the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , respectively. The Company's overall costs to acquire inventory for the same or similar products have generally decreased historically as the Company has been able to leverage its continued growth and execution of merchandising strategies. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed by the Company at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected fiscal year-end inventory levels and costs. Inventory balances at October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016 were as follows: October 8, 2016 January 2, 2016 Inventories at FIFO, net $ 4,143,211 $ 4,009,641 Adjustments to state inventories at LIFO 213,802 165,127 Inventories at LIFO, net $ 4,357,013 $ 4,174,768",

(“GPI”) on January 2, 2014 as part of a multi-year integration plan. As of October 8, 2016 , 316 Carquest stores acquired with GPI had been consolidated into existing Advance Auto Parts stores and 266 stores had been converted to the Advance Auto Parts format. In addition, as of October 8, 2016 the Company had completed the consolidation and conversion of the stores that were acquired with B.W.P. Distributors, Inc. (\"BWP\") on December 31, 2012 (which also operated under the Carquest trade name). During the twelve weeks ended October 8, 2016 a total of 22 Carquest stores were consolidated and 35 Carquest stores were converted. During the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 a total of 139 Carquest stores were consolidated and 107 Carquest stores were converted. Plans are in place to consolidate or convert the remaining Carquest stores over the next few years. As of October 8, 2016 , the Company had 640 stores still operating under the Carquest name. The Company incurred $2,192 and $2,193 of exit costs related to the consolidations and conversions during the twelve weeks ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , respectively, and $17,621 and $7,202 during the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , respectively. Contract termination costs, such as those associated with leases on closed stores, are recognized at the cease-use date. Closed lease liabilities include the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of insurance, property tax and common area maintenance (reduced by the present value of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts). Office Consolidations In June 2014, the Company approved plans to relocate operations from its Minneapolis, Minnesota and Campbell, California offices to other existing offices of the Company, including its offices in Newark, California, Roanoke, Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, and to close its Minneapolis and Campbell offices. The Company also relocated various functions between its existing offices in Roanoke and Raleigh. The relocations and office closings were substantially complete by the end of 2015. The Company incurred restructuring costs of approximately $22,100 under these plans through the end of 2015. Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures. During the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company recognized $431 and $3,459 , respectively, of severance/outplacement benefits under these restructuring plans and other severance related to the acquisition of GPI. During the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company recognized $928 and $3,699 of relocation costs, respectively. Other Exit Activities As of October 10, 2015 the Company had completed its plans approved in August 2014 to consolidate and covert its 40 Autopart International (\"AI\") stores located in Florida into Advance Auto Parts stores. The Company incurred $2,700 of exit costs associated with this plan during the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , consisting primarily of closed facility lease obligations.

ASU 2015-3 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring such costs be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. ASU 2015-15 clarifies that entities may continue to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The adoption of these ASU's has been retrospectively applied and resulted in a reclassification of $6,864 of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long-term debt as of January 2, 2016. Bank Debt The Company has a credit agreement (the “2013 Credit Agreement”) which provides a $1,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub-limit of $300,000 and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed $50,000 . The Company may request, subject to agreement by one or more lenders, that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed $250,000 by those respective lenders (up to a total commitment of $1,250,000 ) during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement the revolving credit facility terminates in December 2018. The 2013 Credit Agreement previously included a term loan, which was repaid in full as of October 8, 2016 . As of October 8, 2016 , under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolver. As of October 8, 2016 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $100,719 , which reduced the availability under the revolver to $899,281 . The letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for the Company’s self-insurance policies. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based, at the Company’s option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin is 1.10% and 0.10% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. A facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility, payable in arrears. The current facility fee rate is 0.15% per annum. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on the Company’s credit rating. The 2013 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) subsidiaries of Advance Stores to, among other things, create, incur or assume additional debt; (b) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur liens, (ii) make loans and investments, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (c) Advance, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and liquidations, (ii) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (iii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting its ability to incur liens on any of its property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of its subsidiaries, and (iv) engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and (d) Advance, among other things, to change its holding company status. Advance and Advance Stores are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio. The 2013 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults to Advance Stores’ other material indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with its covenants with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of October 8, 2016 . Senior Unsecured Notes The Company's 4.50% senior unsecured notes were issued in December 2013 at 99.69% of the principal amount of $450,000 and are due December 1, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company's 4.50% senior unsecured notes were issued in January 2012 at 99.968% of the principal amount of $300,000 and are due January 15, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Company’s 5.75% senior unsecured notes were issued in April 2010 at 99.587% of the principal amount of $300,000 and are due May 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” or collectively with the 2023 Notes and the 2022 Notes, “the Notes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Advance served as the issuer of the Notes with certain of Advance's domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the “Indenture”) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price described in the Indenture. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture for the Notes), the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors. The Company will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the Notes under the circumstances described in the Indenture: (i) upon the release of the guarantee of the Company’s other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt; (ii) upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor; or (iii) upon the Company’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option. The Indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for: (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable; (ii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice; (iii) a default under any debt for money borrowed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $25,000 without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the Trustee or holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; and (iv) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. The Indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. Debt Guarantees The Company is a guarantor of loans made by banks to various independently-owned Carquest stores that are customers of the Company (\"Independents\") totaling $27,258 as of October 8, 2016 . The Company has concluded that some of these guarantees meet the definition of a variable interest in a variable interest entity. However, the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the Independents and therefore is not the primary beneficiary of these stores. Upon entering into a relationship with certain Independents, the Company guaranteed the debt of those stores to aid in the procurement of business loans. These loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers. The approximate value of the inventory collateralized in these agreements is $71,741 as of October 8, 2016 . The Company believes that the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote, and any fair value attributable to these guarantees would be very minimal.",

            "Fair Value Measurements": {
                "value": " Fair Value Measurements: The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets or liabilities. These levels are: • Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. • Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities at the measurement date, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or corroborated by other observable market data. • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities that are not able to be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of a reporting entity’s own assumptions. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis During the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 , the Company had no significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). During the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 , the Company had no significant fair value measurements of non-financial assets or liabilities. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank overdrafts, accounts payable, accrued expenses and the current portion of long term debt approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Company’s senior unsecured notes was determined using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices, and the Company believes that the carrying value of its other long-term debt and certain long-term liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016 , respectively, are as follows: October 8, 2016 January 2, 2016 Carrying Value $ 1,042,633 $ 1,206,297 Fair Value $ 1,135,000 $ 1,262,000 The adoption of ASU 2015-3 resulted in a reclassification of $6,864 of debt issuance costs from Other assets, net to Long-term debt decreasing the carrying value as of January 2, 2016.",

For the twelve week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , earnings of $520 and $425 , respectively, were allocated to the participating securities. For the forty week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , earnings of $1,712 and $1,503 , respectively, were allocated to the participating securities. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by including the effect of dilutive securities. Share-based awards to purchase approximately 22 and 1 shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the common stock during the twelve week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 10, 2015 , respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

                "value": "Share-Based Compensation: The Company grants share-based compensation awards to its Team Members and members of its Board of Directors as provided for under the Company’s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or 2014 LTIP, which was approved by the Company's shareholders on May 14, 2014. Currently, the grants are in the form of stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and deferred stock units (“DSUs”). The Company granted 52 performance-based RSUs, 57 time-based RSUs, 81 performance-based SARs and 69 time-based SARs during the forty week period ended October 8, 2016 . The majority of these grants represent an off-cycle award granted in accordance with the employment agreement reached with the Company’s new CEO hired in April 2016. The weighted average fair values of the performance-based and time-based RSUs granted during the forty week period ended October 8, 2016 were $160.99 and $156.63 per share, respectively. The fair value of each RSU was determined based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair values of the performance-based and time-based SARs granted during the forty week period ended October 8, 2016 were $36.58 and $43.64 per share, respectively. The Company also granted a broad-based incentive award to store and field team members of 364 performance-based RSUs during the twelve-week period ended October 8, 2016 , which vests based on the achievement of performance metrics during the Company's third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2016, subject to a continued one-year service period. The Company expects only 71 of the performance-based RSUs to be earned based on performance. The weighted-average fair value of the performance-based RSUs granted was $164.36 . The fair value of each performance-based RSU was determined based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each SAR was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Black-Scholes Option Valuation Assumptions October 8, 2016 Risk-free interest rate (1) 1.2 % Expected dividend yield 0.2 % Expected stock price volatility (2) 27.7 % Expected life of awards (in months) (3) 55 (1) The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate having a term consistent with the expected life of the award. (2) Expected volatility is determined using a blend of historical and implied volatility. (3) The expected life of the Company's awards represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of previously granted awards. See the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2016 , for a more detailed discussion regarding the terms of the Company’s share-based compensation awards. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Total share-based compensation expense included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations was $2,522 for the twelve week period ended October 8, 2016 and the related income tax benefit recognized was $951 . Total share-based compensation expense included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations was $11,664 for the forty week period ended October 8, 2016 and the related income tax benefit recognized was $4,252 . As of October 8, 2016 , there was $33,263 of unrecognized compensation expense related to all share-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years . The aggregate intrinsic value for outstanding awards at October 8, 2016 was approximately $88,885 based on the Company's closing stock price of $148.13 as of the last trading day of the first fiscal quarter ending October 8, 2016 . For the forty weeks ended October 8, 2016 , the aggregate intrinsic value for awards exercised was $68,810 .",

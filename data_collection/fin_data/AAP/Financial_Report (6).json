            "Basis of Presentation": {
                "value": "Basis of Presentation: The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company and include the accounts of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (\"Advance\"), its wholly owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (\"Advance Stores\"), and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company, the results of its operations and cash flows have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted based upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") interim reporting guidance. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2014 (filed with the SEC on March 3, 2015 ). The accounting policies followed in the presentation of interim financial results are consistent with those followed on an annual basis. These policies are presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The first quarter of each of the Company's fiscal years contains 16 weeks. The Company's remaining three quarters consist of 12 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 which contained 13 weeks due to the 53-week fiscal year in 2014. The Company's next 53-week fiscal year is 2020. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Acquisitions During the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company acquired 23 stores through multiple cash transactions. The aggregate cost of the store acquisitions was $18,893 , the value of which was primarily attributed to inventory, accounts receivable and goodwill. The fair value of assets and liabilities assumed are included in the balance sheet as of October 10, 2015 . Proforma financial information is not provided based on materiality. On January 2, 2014, the Company acquired General Parts International, Inc. (\"GPI\") in an all cash transaction. GPI, formerly a privately-held company, is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for Commercial markets operating under the Carquest and Worldpac trade names. As of the acquisition date, GPI operated 1,223 Carquest stores and 103 Worldpac branches located in 45 states and Canada and serviced approximately 1,400 independently-owned Carquest stores. The Company acquired all of GPI's assets and liabilities as a result of the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of GPI for a purchase price of $2,080,804 (subject to adjustment for certain closing items) consisting of $1,307,991 in cash to GPI's shareholders, the repayment of $694,301 of GPI debt and $78,512 in make-whole fees and transaction related expenses paid by the Company on GPI's behalf. The Company included the financial results of GPI in its consolidated financial statements commencing January 2, 2014. Segment and Related Information As of October 10, 2015 , the Company's operations are comprised of 5,240 stores and 118 distribution branches, which operate in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands primarily under the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,” \"Carquest,\" \"Autopart International\" and \"Worldpac.\" These locations offer a broad selection of brand name, original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") and proprietary automotive replacement parts, accessories, and maintenance items primarily for domestic and imported cars and light trucks. While the mix of do-it-yourself (\"DIY\") and do-it-for-me (\"Commercial\") customers varies among the four store brands, all of the locations serve customers through similar distribution channels. The Company has begun implementation of its plan to fully integrate the Carquest company-operated stores and overall operations into Advance Auto Parts by the end of fiscal 2017 and to eventually integrate the availability of all of the Company's product offerings throughout the entire chain. The Company's Advance Auto Parts operations are comprised of five geographic areas which include the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names. Each of the Advance Auto Parts geographic areas, in addition to Worldpac, are individually considered operating segments which are aggregated into one reportable segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company expanded from three geographic areas, which previously comprised the Advance Auto Parts and Autopart International operations, to five geographic areas inclusive of the Carquest operations, such that Carquest is no longer a separate operating segment. Included in the Company's overall store operations are sales generated from its e-commerce platforms. The Company's e-commerce platforms, primarily consisting of its online websites and Commercial ordering platforms, are part of its integrated operating approach of serving its DIY and Commercial customers. The Company's online websites allow its DIY customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store location or have their purchases shipped directly to them. The majority of the Company's online DIY sales are picked up at store locations. Through the Company's online ordering platforms, Commercial customers can conveniently place orders with a designated store location for delivery to their places of business or pick-up. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-11 \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\" ASU 2015-11 requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net recognizable value, simplifying the current requirement that inventories be measured at the lower of cost or market. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured using the last-in, first-out method or retail inventory method. The guidance will be effective prospectively for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2016; earlier adoption is permitted. As the majority of the Company's inventory is accounted for under the last-in, first-out method, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3 \"Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\" ASU 2015-3 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring such costs be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 \"Interest - Imputed Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\" which clarifies that entities may continue to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within the reporting periods and requires retrospective presentation; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\" This new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.\" The amendments in this ASU require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that expands disclosure requirements and requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will become effective during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year of adoption with public entities permitted to early adopt for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08 \"Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of Equity\", which amends the definition of a discontinued operation in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 205-20 and requires entities to provide additional disclosures about discontinued operations as well as disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued operations criteria. The new guidance changes the definition of a discontinued operation and requires discontinued operations treatment for disposals of a component or group of components that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on an entity’s operations or financial results. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 4, 2015. The adoption of this guidance affects prospective presentation of disposals and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.",

The Company used the LIFO method of accounting for approximately 89% of inventories at October 10, 2015 and 88% of inventories at January 3, 2015 . Under LIFO, the Company’s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories, while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs for inventories purchased in Fiscal 2015 and prior years. As a result of utilizing LIFO, the Company recorded a decrease to cost of sales of $46,356 and $4,172 for the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 and October 4, 2014 , respectively. The Company's overall costs to acquire inventory for the same or similar products have generally decreased historically as the Company has been able to leverage its continued growth, execution of merchandising strategies and realization of supply chain efficiencies. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed by the Company at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected fiscal year-end inventory levels and costs. Inventory balances at October 10, 2015 and January 3, 2015 were as follows: October 10, January 3, Inventories at FIFO, net $ 3,972,375 $ 3,814,123 Adjustments to state inventories at LIFO 169,187 122,832 Inventories at LIFO, net $ 4,141,562 $ 3,936,955",

            "Exit Activities and Impairment": {
                "value": "Exit Activities and Impairment: Office Consolidations In June 2014, the Company approved plans to relocate operations from its Minneapolis, Minnesota and Campbell, California offices to other existing offices of the Company, including its offices in Newark, California, Roanoke, Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, and to close its Minneapolis and Campbell offices. The Company also relocated various functions between its existing offices in Roanoke and Raleigh. The relocations and office closings are substantially complete as of October 10, 2015 . In connection with these relocations and office closings, the Company relocated some employees and terminated the employment of others. The Board of Directors of the Company approved this action in order to take advantage of synergies following the acquisition of GPI and to capitalize on the strength of existing locations and organizational experience. The Company estimates that it will incur restructuring costs of approximately $23,300 under these plans through the end of 2015. Substantially all of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures. This estimate includes approximately $10,700 of employee severance costs and $12,600 of relocation costs, most of which has been incurred as of October 10, 2015 . Employees receiving severance/outplacement benefits were required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits. Therefore, the severance/outplacement benefits are recognized over the related service periods. During the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 the Company recognized $431 and $3,459 , respectively, of severance/outplacement benefits under these restructuring plans and other severance related to the acquisition of GPI. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate employees, are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. During the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 the Company recognized $928 and $3,699 , respectively, of relocation costs. Integration of Carquest stores The Company also approved plans in June 2014 to begin consolidating its Carquest stores acquired on January 2, 2014. As of October 10, 2015 , 152 Carquest stores had been consolidated into existing Advance Auto Parts stores and 118 Carquest stores had been converted to the Advance Auto Parts format. This includes the consolidation of 54 Carquest stores and conversion of 108 Carquest stores during the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 . Plans are in place to consolidate or convert the remaining Carquest stores by the middle of 2017. In addition, the Company will continue to consolidate or convert the remaining 33 stores that were acquired with B.W.P. Distributors, Inc. (\"BWP\") on December 31, 2012 (which also operate under the Carquest trade name), 37 of which had been consolidated and 34 had been converted as of October 10, 2015 . Three of these stores were consolidated and two stores were converted during the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 . The Company estimates that the total exit costs to be incurred as a result of consolidations and conversions during Fiscal 2015 will be approximately $8,400 , consisting primarily of closed store lease obligations. The Company incurred $2,193 and $7,202 of exit costs related to the consolidations and conversions during the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , respectively. Contract termination costs, such as those associated with leases on closed stores, will be recognized at the cease-use date. Closed lease liabilities include the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of insurance, property tax and common area maintenance (reduced by the present value of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts). Other Exit Activities In August 2014, the Company approved plans to consolidate and convert its 40 Autoparts International (\"AI\") stores located in Florida into Advance Auto Parts stores. As of October 10, 2015 , all of the AI consolidations and conversions were complete. During the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company incurred $2,700 of exit costs associated with these plans. In July 2015, the Company approved a plan to close 50 under-performing Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and AI stores during the remainder of 2015 and to eliminate certain positions at its corporate offices. The majority of the corporate office eliminations were effective during the twelve weeks ended October 10, 2015 . The Company expects to recognize approximately $6,000 related to the elimination of corporate office positions, most of which was recognized during the twelve weeks ended October 10, 2015 . In November 2015, the Company approved a plan to close an additional 30 under-performing stores during 2015. The Company estimates that it will incur restructuring costs of $26,000 to $35,000 related to the 80 store closures, primarily consisting of closed store lease obligations. Substantially all of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures. The amount recognized for these store closures during the twelve weeks ended October 10, 2015 was insignificant.

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill In 2014, the Company recorded an increase to intangible assets of $757,453 related to the acquisition of GPI and nine stores. The increase included customer relationships of $330,293 which are being amortized over 12 years , non-competes totaling $50,695 which are being amortized over 5 years and favorable leases of $56,465 which are being amortized over the life of the respective leases at a weighted average of 4.5 years .

The revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub-limit of $300,000 and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed $50,000 . The Company may request, subject to agreement by one or more lenders, that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed $250,000 by those respective lenders (up to a total commitment of $1,250,000 ) during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement the revolving credit facility terminates in December 2018 and the term loan matures in January 2019. As of October 10, 2015 , under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $60,000 under the revolver and $180,000 under the term loan. As of October 10, 2015 , the Company also had letters of credit outstanding of $118,622 , which reduced the availability under the revolver to $821,378 . The letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for the Company’s self-insurance policies. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based, at the Company’s option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin is 1.10% and 0.10% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. A facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility, payable in arrears. The current facility fee rate is 0.15% per annum. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on the Company’s credit rating. The interest rate on the term loan is based, at the Company’s option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin is 1.25% and 0.25% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. Under the terms of the term loan, the interest rate is subject to change based on the Company’s credit rating. The 2013 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) subsidiaries of Advance Stores to, among other things, create, incur or assume additional debt; (b) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur liens, (ii) make loans and investments, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (c) Advance, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and liquidations, (ii) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (iii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting its ability to incur liens on any of its property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of its subsidiaries, and (iv) engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and (d) Advance, among other things, to change its holding company status. Advance and Advance Stores are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio. The 2013 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults to Advance Stores’ other material indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with its covenants with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of October 10, 2015 . Senior Unsecured Notes The Company's 4.50% senior unsecured notes were issued in December 2013 at 99.69% of the principal amount of $450,000 and are due December 1, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company's 4.50% senior unsecured notes were issued in January 2012 at 99.968% of the principal amount of $300,000 and are due January 15, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Company’s 5.75% senior unsecured notes were issued in April 2010 at 99.587% of the principal amount of $300,000 and are due May 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” or collectively with the 2023 Notes and the 2022 Notes, “the Notes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Advance served as the issuer of the Notes with certain of Advance's domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the “Indenture”) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price described in the Indenture. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture for the Notes), the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors. The Company will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the Notes under the circumstances described in the Indenture: (i) upon the release of the guarantee of the Company’s other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt; (ii) upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor; or (iii) upon the Company’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option. The Indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for: (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable; (ii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice; (iii) a default under any debt for money borrowed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $25,000 without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the Trustee or holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; and (iv) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. The Indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. Debt Guarantees The Company is a guarantor of loans made by banks to various independently-owned Carquest stores that are customers of the Company (\"Independents\") totaling $28,764 as of October 10, 2015 . The Company has concluded that some of these guarantees meet the definition of a variable interest in a variable interest entity. However, the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the Independents and therefore is not the primary beneficiary of these stores. Upon entering into a relationship with certain Independents, the Company guaranteed the debt of those stores to aid in the procurement of business loans. These loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers. The approximate value of the inventory collateralized in these agreements is $68,498 as of October 10, 2015 . The Company believes that the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote, and any fair value attributable to these guarantees would be very minimal.",

            "Fair Value Measurements": {
                "value": " Fair Value Measurements: The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets or liabilities. These levels are: • Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. • Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities at the measurement date, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or corroborated by other observable market data. • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities that are not able to be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of a reporting entity’s own assumptions. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis During the forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company had no significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). During the twelve and forty weeks ended October 10, 2015 , the Company recorded impairment charges of $2,744 and $8,735 , respectively, on various store and corporate assets. The remaining fair value of these assets was not significant. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The carrying amount of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank overdrafts, accounts payable, accrued expenses and the current portion of long term debt approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Company’s senior unsecured notes was determined using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices, and the Company believes that the carrying value of its other long-term debt and certain long-term liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 10, 2015 and January 3, 2015 , respectively, are as follows: October 10, January 3, Carrying Value $ 1,293,102 $ 1,636,311 Fair Value $ 1,361,000 $ 1,728,000 ",

                "value": "Basis of Presentation Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries is a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, serving both \"do-it-for-me\", or Professional, and \"do-it-yourself\", or DIY customers. The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company and include the accounts of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (\"Advance\"), its wholly owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (\"Advance Stores\"), and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as \"Advance\", \"we\", \"us\", \"our\" or \"the Company\"). As of April 22, 2017 , the Company operated a total of 5,059 stores and 130 distribution branches primarily within the United States, with additional locations in Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Company's stores operate primarily under the trade names \"Advance Auto Parts,\" \"Carquest\" and \"Autopart International,\" and our distribution branches operate under the \"Worldpac\" trade name. In addition, the Company serves approximately 1,250 independently-owned Carquest branded stores (\"independent stores\") as of April 22, 2017 across the same geographic locations served by the Company's stores in addition to Mexico, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, the British Virgin Islands and the Pacific Islands. The accounting policies followed in the presentation of interim financial results are consistent with those followed on an annual basis. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company, the results of its operations and cash flows have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted based upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") interim reporting guidance. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2016 as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017 . The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The first quarter of each of the Company's fiscal years contains 16 weeks. The Company's remaining three quarters consist of 12 weeks. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" aimed at simplifying certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. The areas for simplification include the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and recorded a cumulative effect reduction to beginning retained earnings of $490 related to the Company's election to record forfeitures as they occur. In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively adopt the provision regarding the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, which resulted in an increase in our net cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in our net cash provided by financing activities of $13,145 for the sixteen weeks ended April 23, 2016. The provision requiring the inclusion of excess tax benefits (deficits) as a component of the provision for income taxes in the consolidated results of operations will be applied prospectively. The Company recorded excess tax benefits of $4,104 as a reduction in Provision for income taxes during the sixteen weeks ended April 22, 2017 . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" This ASU is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. It will require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases, including those leases previously classified as operating leases under current GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. From a balance sheet perspective, the Company expects adoption of the new standard to have a material effect on its Total assets and Total liabilities as a result of recording the required right of use asset and associated lease liability. However, the Company has not completed its analysis and is unable to quantify the impact at this time. At this time the Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations as the majority of its leases will remain operating in nature. As such, the expense recognition will be similar to previously required straight-line expense treatment. The Company is also in the process of identifying changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard in 2019. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\" This ASU, along with subsequent ASU's issued to clarify certain provisions of ASU 2014-09, is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that expands disclosure requirements and requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method. The Company is currently analyzing the impact of ASU 2014-09, as amended, on its revenue contracts, comparing the Company's current accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard and identifying potential differences that would result from applying the new standard to its contracts. At this time, the Company does not expect adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to business processes, controls or systems as a result of adopting the new standard.",

An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed by the Company at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.

The Company believes the carrying value of its other long-term debt approximates fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments. Bank Debt On January 31, 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement which provides a $1,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) with Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent. This new revolver under the 2017 Credit Agreement replaced the revolver under the 2013 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of $200,000 . The Company may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding $250,000 during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving loan balance, if any, are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement terminates in January 2022; however, the Company may request one or two one-year extensions of the termination date prior to the first or second anniversary of the closing date. As of April 22, 2017 , under the 2017 Credit Agreement, the Company had $30,000 outstanding borrowings under the revolver. As of April 22, 2017 , the Company also had letters of credit outstanding of $100,719 , which in conjunction with certain covenant restrictions reduced the availability under the revolver to $787,788 . The letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for the Company’s self-insurance policies. The interest rates on outstanding amounts, if any, on the revolving facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement will be based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. After an initial interest period, the Company may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type. The initial margins per annum for the revolving loan are 1.10% for the adjusted LIBOR and 0.10% for alternate base rate borrowings. A facility fee of 0.15% per annum will be charged on the total revolving facility commitment, payable quarterly in arrears. Under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement, the interest rate spread, facility fee and commitment fee will be based on the Company’s credit rating. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) create, incur or assume additional debt (only with respect to subsidiaries of Advance Stores), (ii) incur liens, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (b) Advance, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (ii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting their ability to incur liens on any of their property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of their subsidiaries; and (c) Advance, among other things, to change the holding company status of Advance. Advance Stores is required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio. The 2017 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults of Advance Stores’ other material indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants with respect to the 2017 Credit Agreement as of April 22, 2017 . Debt Guarantees The Company is a guarantor of loans made by banks to various independently-owned Carquest branded stores that are customers of the Company totaling $24,426 as of April 22, 2017 . These loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers. The approximate value of the inventory collateralized by these agreements is $67,046 as of April 22, 2017 . The Company believes that the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote, and any fair value attributable to these guarantees would be very minimal.",

The Company sells its products worldwide through its\nretail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as\nthrough third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells\na variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including\napplication software and various accessories through its online and\nretail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of\nthe Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and\nrecurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement\npresentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nCertain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements have been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the\nCompany\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and the\nnotes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended September 26, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Form\n10-K\u201d). The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week\nperiod that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every\nsix years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years 2016 and 2015 each include 52 weeks.\nUnless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters\nor months refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in\nSeptember and the associated quarters or months of those fiscal\nyears. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company\nadopted an accounting standard that simplified the presentation of\ndeferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be\nclassified as noncurrent in a classified statement of\nfinancial position. The Company has adopted this accounting\nstandard prospectively; accordingly, the prior period amounts in\nthe Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were not adjusted to conform to\nthe new accounting standard. The adoption of this accounting\nstandard was not material to the Company\u2019s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nEarnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing\nincome available to common shareholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available\nto common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the period increased to include the\nnumber of additional shares of common stock that would have been\noutstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.\nPotentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,\nshares to be purchased under the Company\u2019s employee stock\npurchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted\nstock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). The dilutive effect of\npotentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the\ntreasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock can result in a greater dilutive\neffect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table shows the computation of basic\nand diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods\nended March 26, 2016 and March 28, 2015 (net income in\nmillions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nMarch 26, 2016 March 28, 2015 March 26, 2016 March 28, 2015\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 10,516 $ 13,569 $ 28,877 $ 31,593\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding 5,514,381 5,793,799 5,536,656 5,818,441\nEffect of dilutive securities 26,505 41,059 30,850 39,889\nWeighted-average diluted shares 5,540,886 5,834,858 5,567,506 5,858,330\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.91 $ 2.34 $ 5.22 $ 5.43\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.90 $ 2.33 $ 5.19 $ 5.39 Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would\nhave been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted\nearnings per share.",

The Company may sell certain of its marketable\nsecurities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration\nand duration management. The maturities of the Company\u2019s\nlong-term marketable securities generally range from one to five\nyears. The Company considers the declines in market value\nof its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary\nin nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated\nsecurities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount\nof credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires\ninvestments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were\ndetermined for each individual security in the investment\nportfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary\nimpairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time\nand extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the\nfinancial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes\nin market interest rates and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or\nwhether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the\ninvestment before recovery of the investment\u2019s cost basis. As\nof March 26, 2016, the Company does not consider any of its\ninvestments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\nDerivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset\nits business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on\nexpected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.\nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for\na variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting\nconsiderations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging\nparticular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will\noffset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in\nlocal currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory\npurchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\ncontracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may\ndesignate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company\ntypically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\nfor up to 12 months.\nTo help protect the net investment in a foreign\noperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\ninvestments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial\ninstruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as\neconomic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges. The Company may also enter into non-designated\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of\ncertain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,\noptions, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\ninstruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,\nor changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s term debt or\ninvestments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges. The Company\u2019s hedged interest\nrate transactions as of March 26, 2016 are expected to be\nrecognized within ten years.\nCash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in\nearnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of\nnet sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,\nand deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of\ninventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales\nin the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred\ngains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest\nincome or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in\nthe same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The\nineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness\ntesting of cash flow hedges are recognized in other\nincome/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow\nhedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially\nidentified time period or within a subsequent two-month time\nperiod. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\nderivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other\nincome/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such\nderivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net\nunless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\nNet Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective\nportions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net\ninvestment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense),\nnet.\nFair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value\nhedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss\nor gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged\nitem.\nNon-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all derivatives in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The\nCompany\u2019s accounting treatment for these derivative\ninstruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables\nshow the Company\u2019s derivative instruments at gross fair value\nas of March 26, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in\nmillions):\nMarch 26, 2016\nFair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value\nDerivative assets (1)\nForeign exchange contracts $ 564 $ 69 $ 633\nInterest rate contracts $ 557 $ 0 $ 557\nDerivative liabilities (2)\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1,033 $ 243 $ 1,276\nInterest rate contracts $ 36 $ 0 $ 36\nSeptember 26, 2015\nFair Value of as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated Total Fair Value\nDerivative assets (1)\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1,442 $ 109 $ 1,551\nInterest rate contracts $ 394 $ 0 $ 394\nDerivative liabilities (2)\nForeign exchange contracts $ 905 $ 94 $ 999\nInterest rate contracts $ 13 $ 0 $ 13\n(1)\nThe fair value of derivative assets is measured\nusing Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current\nassets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nThe fair value of derivative liabilities is\nmeasured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as accrued\nexpenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The credit risk amounts\nrepresent the Company\u2019s gross exposure to potential\naccounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or\nunsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the\nterms of the contract, based on then-current The Company generally enters into master netting\narrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same\ncounterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of\ncertain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually\nestablished thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 26, 2016,\nthe net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative\ninstruments under its collateral security arrangements was $3\nmillion, which was recorded as other current assets in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options\noutstanding as of March 26, 2016 was $100 million, which\nrepresents the value of the Company\u2019s closing stock price on\nthe last trading day of the period in excess of the\nweighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options\noutstanding.\nShare-Based Compensation The following table shows a summary of the\nshare-based compensation expense included in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month\nperiods ended March 26, 2016 and March 28, 2015 (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nMarch 26, March 28, March 26, March 28,\nCost of sales $ 191 $ 142 $ 395 $ 282\nResearch and development 468 384 934 758\nSelling, general and administrative 389 401 797 775\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 1,048 $ 927 $ 2,126 $ 1,815\nThe income tax benefit related to share-based\ncompensation expense was $347 million and $760 million for the\nthree- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2016,\nrespectively, and was $311 million and $662 million for the three-\nand six-month periods ended March 28, 2015, respectively.

Other agreements entered into by the Company\nsometimes include indemnification provisions under which the\nCompany could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\ninfringement claim against the Company or an indemnified\nthird-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\nloss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating\nsystem or application software for infringement of third-party\nintellectual property rights. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which\nis available to customers who purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in\none of its U.S. physical retail stores and activate the purchased\niPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade\nProgram provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a\nnew iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. One of the\nconditions of this program requires the customer to finance the\ninitial purchase price of the iPhone with a third-party lender.\nUpon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone,\nthe Company satisfies the customer\u2019s outstanding balance due\nto the third-party lender on the original device. The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and\nrecognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right\nwith subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized\nwithin revenue. The Company has entered into indemnification\nagreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these\nagreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to\nthe fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise\nby reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance\nexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related\nlegal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum\npotential amount of payments the Company could be required to make\nunder these agreements due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors\nand officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to\nsuch obligations.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials\nand Product Although most components essential to the\nCompany\u2019s business are generally available from multiple\nsources, a number of components are currently obtained from single\nor limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for mobile\ncommunication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,\nmany components used by the Company, including those that are\navailable from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are\nnot commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only\none source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019\nyields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the\nCompany\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product\nwere delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed\nshipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially\nadversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial\nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending\non the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\noriginal source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\nfrom an alternative source. Continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if\nthose suppliers concentrated on the production of common components\ninstead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the\nsupply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\nsimilar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to\nsignificant risks of supply shortages and price increases that\ncould materially adversely affect its financial condition and\noperating results. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware\nproducts are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these\noutsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components\nand manufacturers for many of the Company\u2019s products.\nAlthough the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on\nmanufacturing schedules, the Company\u2019s operating results\ncould be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable\nto meet their production commitments. The Company\u2019s purchase\ncommitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150\ndays.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nOperating Leases The Company leases various equipment and\nfacilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating\nlease arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for\nterms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year\nrenewal options. As of March 26, 2016, the Company had a total\nof 475 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging\nfrom five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and\noften contain multi-year renewal options. As of March 26,\n2016, the Company\u2019s total future minimum lease payments under\nnoncancelable operating leases were $6.8 billion, of which $3.9\nbillion related to leases for retail space.\nContingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings\nand claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and\nthat have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are\ndiscussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the\nheading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading \u201cRisk\nFactors.\u201d In the opinion of management, there was not at\nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual,\nwith respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\nclaims. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nTherefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an\noutcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were\nresolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in\nexcess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements for that reporting period could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., et al. On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict\nawarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung\nElectronics Co., Ltd. and affiliated parties in the United States\nDistrict Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.\nOn March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in\nfavor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930\nmillion. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the\ndecision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals\nordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of\napproximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine\nsupplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for\nproducts subject to the reversal in part. Samsung paid $548 million\nto the Company in December 2015, which was included in net sales in\nthe Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nBecause the case remains subject to further proceedings, the\nCompany has not recognized any further amounts in its results of\noperations. On March 21, 2016, the United States Supreme Court\nagreed to hear Samsung\u2019s request for appeal related to the\n$548 million in damages.",

The Company manages its business primarily on a\ngeographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable operating segments\nconsist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of\nAsia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South\nAmerica. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as\nIndia, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment\nincludes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific\nsegment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included\nin the Company\u2019s other reportable operating segments.\nAlthough the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware\nand software products and similar services, each one is managed\nseparately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics\nof each geographic region.

The Company evaluates the performance of its\nreportable operating segments based on net sales and operating\nincome. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on\nthe location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s\nretail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating\nincome for each segment includes net sales to third parties,\nrelated cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable\nto the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the\ngeographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred.\nOperating income for each segment excludes other income and expense\nand certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating\nsegments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include\nvarious corporate expenses such as research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation\nexpenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other\nseparately managed general and administrative costs.

The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes.

There can be no assurance the hedges will\noffset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in\nlocal currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory\npurchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\ncontracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may\ndesignate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company\ntypically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\nfor up to 12 months.\nTo help protect the net investment in a foreign\noperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\ninvestments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial\ninstruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as\neconomic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges. The Company may also enter into non-designated\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of\ncertain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,\noptions, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\ninstruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,\nor changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s term debt or\ninvestments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges. The Company\u2019s hedged interest\nrate transactions as of March 26, 2016 are expected to be\nrecognized within ten years.\nCash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in\nearnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of\nnet sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,\nand deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of\ninventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales\nin the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred\ngains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest\nincome or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in\nthe same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The\nineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness\ntesting of cash flow hedges are recognized in other\nincome/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow\nhedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially\nidentified time period or within a subsequent two-month time\nperiod. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\nderivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other\nincome/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such\nderivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net\nunless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\nNet Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective\nportions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net\ninvestment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense),\nnet.\nFair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value\nhedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss\nor gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged\nitem.\nNon-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates.",

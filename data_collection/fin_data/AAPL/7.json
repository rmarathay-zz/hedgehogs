The Company sells its products worldwide through its\nretail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as\nthrough third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells\na variety of third-party Apple compatible products, including\napplication software and various accessories through its online and\nretail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of\nthe Company\u2019s management, the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and\nrecurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement\npresentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. Actual results could differ materially from those\nestimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the\nCompany\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements and the\nnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014,\nincluded in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by the\nCompany\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 28,\n2015 (hereinafter, the \u201c2014 Form 10-K\u201d). The\nCompany\u2019s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends\non the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included\nin the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to\nrealign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company\u2019s\nfiscal years 2015 and 2014 each include 52 weeks. Unless otherwise\nstated, references to particular years, quarters or months refer to\nthe Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters or months of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing\nincome available to common shareholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available\nto common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the period increased to include the\nnumber of additional shares of common stock that would have been\noutstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.\nPotentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,\nshares to be purchased under the Company\u2019s employee stock\npurchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted\nstock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). The dilutive effect of\npotentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the\ntreasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock can result in a greater dilutive\neffect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table shows the computation of basic\nand diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month\nperiods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014 (net income\nin millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 27, 2015 June 28, 2014 June 27, 2015 June 28, 2014\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 10,677 $ 7,748 $ 42,270 $ 31,043\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding 5,729,886 6,012,635 5,788,922 6,136,147\nEffect of dilutive securities 43,213 39,076 40,998 36,710\nWeighted-average diluted shares 5,773,099 6,051,711 5,829,920 6,172,857\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.86 $ 1.29 $ 7.30 $ 5.06\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.85 $ 1.28 $ 7.25 $ 5.03\nPotentially dilutive securities whose effect would\nhave been antidilutive were not significant for the three- and\nnine-month periods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.\nThe Company excluded these securities from the computation of\ndiluted earnings per share.",

The net realized gains or losses\nrecognized by the Company related to such sales were not\nsignificant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014. The maturities of the\nCompany\u2019s long-term marketable securities generally range\nfrom one to five years. As of June 27, 2015 and September 27,\n2014, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that\nhad been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were\nnot significant. During the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, the Company did not\nrecognize any significant impairment charges. As of June 27,\n2015, the Company considers the declines in market value of its\nmarketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in\nnature and does not consider any of its investments\nother-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in\nhighly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits\nthe amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy\ngenerally requires investments to be investment grade, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal\nloss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for\nother-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as\nthe length of time and extent to which fair value has been below\nits cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any\nchanges thereto, changes in market interest rates and the\nCompany\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than\nnot it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of\nthe investment\u2019s cost basis.\nDerivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset\nits business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on\nexpected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.\nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for\na variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting\nconsiderations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging\nparticular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will\noffset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in\nlocal currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory\npurchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\ncontracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may\ndesignate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company\ntypically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\nfor up to 12 months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign\noperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\ninvestments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial\ninstruments, such as its foreign-currency-denominated debt, as\neconomic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges. The Company may also enter into non-designated\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of\ncertain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,\noptions, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\ninstruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,\nor changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s long-term debt or\ninvestments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges. The Company\u2019s hedged interest\nrate transactions as of June 27, 2015 are expected to be\nrecognized within 12 years.\nCash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in\nearnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of\nnet sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,\nand deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of\ninventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales\nin the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred\ngains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest\nincome or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in\nthe same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from\nthe effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in\nother income/(expense), net. These amounts were not significant\nduring the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2015\nand June 28, 2014.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow\nhedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially\nidentified time period or within a subsequent two-month time\nperiod. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\nderivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other\nincome/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such\nderivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net\nunless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The\nCompany did not recognize any significant net gains or losses\nrelated to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow\nhedges during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27,\n2015 and June 28, 2014.\nNet Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective\nportions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net\ninvestment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net and\nwere not significant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.\nFair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value\nhedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss\nor gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged\nitem. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the\neffectiveness testing of fair value hedges recognized were not\nsignificant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.\nNon-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The\nnet gains and losses recognized for foreign currency forward and\noption contracts not designated as hedging instruments were not\nsignificant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014. The Company records all derivatives in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The\nCompany\u2019s accounting treatment for these derivative\ninstruments is based on its hedge designation.

To further limit credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of\ncertain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually\nestablished thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 27, 2015 and\nSeptember 27, 2014, the Company received $2.1 billion of cash\ncollateral related to the derivative instruments under its\ncollateral security arrangements, which were recorded as other\ncurrent liabilities within accrued expenses in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the\nrespective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative\ncontracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions\nwith a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\nJune 27, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential\neffects of these rights of set-off associated with the\nCompany\u2019s derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and\nderivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion,\nrespectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities\nof $868 million and $549 million, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables\noutstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers that\nare not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements\nor credit insurance.

As of September 27, 2014, the Company\nhad two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade\nreceivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The\nCompany\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 57% and 72%\nof trade receivables as of June 27, 2015 and\nSeptember 27, 2014, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables Additionally, the Company has non-trade receivables\nfrom certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale\nof components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company.

Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca\nMaestri, Daniel Riccio and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading\nplans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the\nExchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that\npre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for\ndetermining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or\nsales of the Company\u2019s stock, including shares acquired\npursuant to the Company\u2019s employee and director equity\nplans.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related\ninformation for the nine months ended June 27, 2015 is as\nfollows:\nNumber of RSUs Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Aggregate Intrinsic Value\nBalance at September 27, 2014 103,822 $ 70.98\nRSUs granted 41,679 $ 104.26\nRSUs vested (37,495 ) $ 71.13\nRSUs cancelled (4,461 ) $ 77.71\nBalance at June 27, 2015 103,545 $ 84.03 $ 13,124\nRSUs that vested during the three- and nine-month\nperiods ended June 27, 2015 had fair values of $2.3 billion\nand $4.3 billion, respectively, as of the vesting date. RSUs that\nvested during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28,\n2014 had fair values of $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion,\nrespectively, as of the vesting date.\nStock Options The Company had 1.6 million stock options\noutstanding as of June 27, 2015, with a weighted-average\nexercise price per share of $16.62 and weighted-average remaining\ncontractual term of 3.4 years, substantially all of which are\nexercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options\noutstanding as of June 27, 2015 was $177 million, which\nrepresents the value of the Company\u2019s closing stock price on\nthe last trading day of the period in excess of the\nweighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options\noutstanding. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of\nexercise was $72 million and $439 million for the three- and\nnine-month periods ended June 27, 2015, respectively, and $271\nmillion and $978 million for the three- and nine-month periods\nended June 28, 2014, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation The following table shows a summary of the\nshare-based compensation expense included in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month\nperiods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014 (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 27, 2015 June 28, 2014 June 27, 2015 June 28, 2014\nCost of sales $ 148 $ 115 $ 430 $ 334\nResearch and development 388 313 1,146 902\nSelling, general and administrative 320 296 1,095 865\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 856 $ 724 $ 2,671 $ 2,101\nThe income tax benefit related to share-based\ncompensation expense was $286 million and $948 million for the\nthree- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2015,\nrespectively, and was $260 million and $755 million for the three-\nand nine-month periods ended June 28, 2014, respectively.

Other agreements entered into by the Company\nsometimes include indemnification provisions under which the\nCompany could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\ninfringement claim against the Company or an indemnified\nthird-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any\nsignificant payments resulting from such an infringement claim\nasserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion\nof management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\nCompany may have incurred a material loss with respect to\nindemnification of end-users of its operating system or application\nsoftware for infringement of third-party intellectual property\nrights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement\ncosts related to indemnification as of June 27, 2015 or\nSeptember 27, 2014. The Company has entered into indemnification\nagreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these\nagreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to\nthe fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise\nby reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance\nexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related\nlegal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum\npotential amount of payments the Company could be required to make\nunder these agreements due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors\nand officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to\nsuch obligations, and payments made under these agreements\nhistorically have not been material.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials\nand Product Although most components essential to the\nCompany\u2019s business are generally available from multiple\nsources, a number of components are currently obtained from single\nor limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for mobile\ncommunication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,\nmany components used by the Company, including those that are\navailable from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are\nnot commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only\none source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019\nyields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the\nCompany\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product\nwere delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed\nshipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially\nadversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial\nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending\non the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\noriginal source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\nfrom an alternative source. Continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if\nthose suppliers concentrated on the production of common components\ninstead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the\nsupply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\nsimilar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to\nsignificant risks of supply shortages and price increases that\ncould materially adversely affect its financial condition and\noperating results. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware\nproducts are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these\noutsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components\nand manufacturers for many of the Company\u2019s products.\nAlthough the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on\nmanufacturing schedules, the Company\u2019s operating results\ncould be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable\nto meet their production commitments. The Company\u2019s purchase\ncommitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150\ndays.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nOperating Leases The Company leases various equipment and\nfacilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating\nlease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any\nother off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility\nleases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally\ncontain multi-year renewal options. As of June 27, 2015, the\nCompany had a total of 456 retail stores. Leases for retail space\nare for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which\nare for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As\nof June 27, 2015, the Company\u2019s total future minimum\nlease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0\nbillion, of which $3.4 billion related to leases for retail\nspace.\nOther Commitments The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners\nto manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and\nto perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These\noutsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on\ndemand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers\nperiods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual\ncomponents for its products from a wide variety of individual\nsuppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires\ncomponents through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\ncontracts and open orders based on projected demand information.\nWhere appropriate, the purchases are applied\nto inventory component prepayments that\nare outstanding with the respective supplier. As of\nJune 27, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet\nthird-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase\ncommitments of $21.7 billion. In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the\nCompany had other off-balance sheet obligations of $4.8 billion as\nof June 27, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire\ncapital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process\nequipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and\ndevelopment (\u201cR&D\u201d), internet and\ntelecommunications services, energy and other obligations.\nSubsequent to June 27, 2015, the Company entered into\nadditional other off-balance sheet obligations of $2.1 billion.\nContingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings\nand claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and\nthat have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are\ndiscussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the\nheading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading \u201cRisk\nFactors.\u201d In the opinion of management, there was not at\nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual,\nwith respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of\nlitigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or\nmore of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a\nreporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s\nexpectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nfor that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected.\nSmartflash LLC, et al., v. Apple Inc., et al. On May 29, 2013, Smartflash LLC and Smartflash\nTechnologies Limited filed an action against the Company in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,\nTyler Division, alleging that the Company infringed certain patents\nrelating to data storage and access systems. On February 24,\n2015, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded\ndamages of approximately $533 million. On July 7, 2015, the\nDistrict Court vacated the award and ordered a new trial for\ndamages. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a loss accrual\nat this time.\nApple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict\nawarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung\nElectronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States\nDistrict Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.\nOn March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in\nfavor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930\nmillion. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the\ndecision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals\nordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of\napproximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine\nsupplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for\nproducts subject to the reversal in part. Because the ruling\nremains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not\nrecognized the award in its results of operations.",

There can be no assurance the hedges will\noffset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in\nlocal currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory\npurchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\ncontracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may\ndesignate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company\ntypically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\nfor up to 12 months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign\noperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\ninvestments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial\ninstruments, such as its foreign-currency-denominated debt, as\neconomic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges. The Company may also enter into non-designated\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of\ncertain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,\noptions, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\ninstruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,\nor changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s long-term debt or\ninvestments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges. The Company\u2019s hedged interest\nrate transactions as of June 27, 2015 are expected to be\nrecognized within 12 years.\nCash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in\nearnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of\nnet sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,\nand deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of\ninventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales\nin the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred\ngains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest\nincome or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in\nthe same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from\nthe effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in\nother income/(expense), net. These amounts were not significant\nduring the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2015\nand June 28, 2014.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow\nhedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially\nidentified time period or within a subsequent two-month time\nperiod. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\nderivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other\nincome/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such\nderivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net\nunless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The\nCompany did not recognize any significant net gains or losses\nrelated to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow\nhedges during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27,\n2015 and June 28, 2014.\nNet Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective\nportions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net\ninvestment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net and\nwere not significant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.\nFair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value\nhedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss\nor gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged\nitem. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the\neffectiveness testing of fair value hedges recognized were not\nsignificant during the three- and nine-month periods ended\nJune 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.\nNon-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

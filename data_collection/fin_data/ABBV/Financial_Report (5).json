                "value": "Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation\nBackground\nThe principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Substantially all of AbbVie’s net revenues in the United States are to three wholesalers. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott’s shareholders. In connection with the separation, AbbVie and Abbott entered into transition services agreements covering certain corporate support and back office services that AbbVie historically received from Abbott. Such services included information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, engineering support, quality assurance support and other administrative services. These agreements facilitated the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. The transition services agreements had original terms of up to 24 months, with an option for a one-year extension. The majority of these transaction service agreements expired without extension at December 31, 2014. With certain limited exceptions, the remaining transition services agreements terminated on or prior to December 31, 2015.\nBasis of Historical Presentation\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIt is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs–Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) . The amendments in this standard supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. The core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AbbVie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-4, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities. Accordingly, this standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2018. Early application is permitted for AbbVie only for annual reporting periods starting with the first quarter of 2017. AbbVie is currently assessing the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the implementation approach to be used.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current U.S. GAAP. Amendments are to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. This standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2018. The standard does not permit early adoption with the exception of certain targeted provisions. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supercedes the current lease guidance. The new standard requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The new standard must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption is permitted. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards will be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders’ equity. In addition, the standard will increase the number of shares an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on share-based payment awards and still qualify for the exemption to liability classification. The standard also permits entities to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur as well as clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The guidance will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.",

Pharmacyclics markets IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, targeting B-cell malignancies. The total consideration for the acquisition of Pharmacyclics was $20.8 billion, including cash consideration of $12.4 billion and approximately 128 million shares of AbbVie common stock valued at $8.4 billion.\nThe acquisition of Pharmacyclics was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. This method required, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition has not yet been finalized as of March 31, 2016. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The company did not make any measurement period adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date and may result in significant changes to the recognized assets and liabilities.\nOn March 27, 2015, in connection with the then proposed acquisition of Pharmacyclics, AbbVie entered into an $18 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) and incurred financing-related costs totaling $59 million, which was recorded in interest expense. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the company’s May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes .\nOther Licensing & Acquisitions Activity\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2016, the company recorded acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $10 million. Cash outflows related to acquisitions and investments activity totaled $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and primarily represented a payment to a collaboration partner as a result of the satisfaction of certain conditions under the arrangement for which a charge to IPR&D was recorded in 2015 .\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company recorded IPR&D charges of $127 million. Cash outflows related to acquisitions and investments totaled $736 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and included a $500 million payment to Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) as a result of the satisfaction of certain conditions under the research and development (R&D) collaboration with Calico for which a charge to other operating expenses was recorded in 2014.\nC 2 N Diagnostics\nIn March 2015, AbbVie entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C 2 N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders. As part of the agreement, AbbVie made an initial upfront payment of $100 million, which was expensed to IPR&D in the three months ended March 31, 2015. Upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $685 million, as well as royalties on net sales.",

Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie.\nThe collaboration includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities.

The company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps, based on judgment, to manage interest costs in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company’s outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required.\nFinancial Instruments\nVarious AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were designated as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value. The duration of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2016 will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.\nThe company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts were not designated as hedges and were recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses were reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and were generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, AbbVie held notional amounts of $7.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nAbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts, designated as fair value hedges, totaling $11.0 billion at both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie recorded the contracts at fair value and adjusted the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie’s derivative instruments as of March 31, 2016:\nFair value – Derivatives in asset position\nFair value – Derivatives in liability position\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nHedging instruments\nPrepaid expenses and other\n$ 6\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$\nHedging instruments\nOther long-term assets\nOther long-term liabilities\nOthers not designated as hedges\nPrepaid expenses and other\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nOther long-term assets\nOther long-term liabilities\n—\nTotal derivatives\n$\n$\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie’s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2015:\nFair value – Derivatives in asset position\nFair value – Derivatives in liability position\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nHedging instruments\nPrepaid expenses and other\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$ —\nOthers not designated as hedges\nPrepaid expenses and other\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nOther long-term assets\nOther long-term liabilities\nTotal derivatives\n$\n$\nWhile certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company’s counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe unrealized gains/(losses) for the effective portions of the derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) were ($39) million and $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not significant for the three months ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.\nThe following table summarizes the location in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and the amount of gain/(loss) recognized into net earnings for derivative instruments, including the effective portions of the gain/(loss) reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into net earnings:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\nIncome statement caption\n2016\n2015\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nDesignated as cash flow hedges\nCost of products sold\n$\n$\nNot designated as hedges\nNet foreign exchange loss\n)\n)\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nInterest expense, net\nTotal\n$\n$\n)\nThe gain/(loss) related to fair value hedges is recognized in interest expense, net and directly offsets the (loss)/gain on the underlying hedged item, the fixed-rate debt, resulting in no net impact to interest expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.\nFair Value Measures\nThe fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels:\n·\nLevel 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;\n·\nLevel 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and\n·\nLevel 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities that were carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at March 31, 2016\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nTime deposits\n—\n—\nDebt securities\n—\n—\nEquity securities\n—\n—\nInterest rate hedges\n—\n—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nLiabilities\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n$ —\n$\n$—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$ —\n$\n$—\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities that were carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at December 31,\n2015\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nTime deposits\n—\n—\nEquity securities\n—\n—\nInterest rate hedges\n—\n—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nLiabilities\nInterest rate hedges\n$\n$ —\n$\n$—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$ —\n$\n$—\nThe fair values for time deposits included in cash and equivalents and short-term investments were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis reflecting quoted market rates for the same or similar instruments. The fair values of time deposits approximate their amortized cost due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities were generally based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. Available-for-sale equity securities consists of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using publicized spot curves for interest rate hedges and publicized forward curves for foreign currency contracts.\nThere have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels.\nIn addition to the financial instruments that the company is required to recognize at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that were recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are shown in the table below:\nBook values\nApproximate fair values\n(in millions)\nMarch 31, 2016\nDecember 31,\n2015\nMarch 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the approximate fair values of the financial instruments as of March 31, 2016:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nFair Value at March 31, 2016\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nInvestments\n$ 35\n$ —\n$ —\n$\nTotal assets\n$ 35\n$ —\n$ —\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n$ 400\n$ —\n$\n$ —\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\n—\n—\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n$\n$ —\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the approximate fair values of the financial instruments as of December 31, 2015:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nFair Value at December 31, 2015\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nInvestments\n$ 37\n$ —\n$ —\n$\nTotal assets\n$ 37\n$ —\n$ —\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n$ 406\n$ —\n$\n$ —\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\n—\n—\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n$\n$ —\nInvestments consist of cost method investments. To determine the fair values of other cost method investments, the company takes into consideration recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee, which represents a Level 3 basis of fair value measurement. The fair values of short-term and current borrowings approximate the carrying values due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nThe fair values of long-term debt, excluding fair value hedges and the term loans, were determined by using the published market price for the debt instruments, without consideration of transaction costs, which represents a Level 1 basis of fair value measurement. The fair values of the term loans were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using quoted market rates, which represents a Level 2 basis of fair value measurement. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions.\nAvailable-for-sale Securities\nSubstantially all of the company’s investments in debt and equity securities were classified as available-for-sale. As of March 31, 2016, approximately $1.2 billion of the company’s debt securities were classified as short-term. The company’s long-term debt securities mature within five years. There were no material debt securities outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Estimated fair values of available-for-sale securities were generally based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. The following table is a summary of available-for-sale securities by type as of March 31, 2016:\nAmortized\nGross unrealized\nFair\n(in millions)\nCost\nGains\nLosses\nValue\nU.S. government securities\n$\n$ —\n$—\n$\nCorporate debt securities\n—\nOther debt securities\n—\n—\nEquity securities\n)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n) $\nAbbVie periodically assesses its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security including any changes to the credit rating of the security, and the intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. Based on a review of these securities, AbbVie had no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities as of March 31, 2016.\nRealized gains and losses on sales of investments were computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in earnings. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, realized gains and losses were immaterial.\nConcentrations of Risk\nThe functional currency of the company’s Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. At December 31, 2015, there were three legal exchange mechanisms administered by the Venezuelan government. These were the official rate of 6.3, the SICAD rate of approximately 13.5, and the SIMADI rate of approximately 200. Effective March 10, 2016, the Venezuelan government devalued the official rate of 6.3 to 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, eliminated the SICAD rate, and replaced SIMADI with a new exchange mechanism called DICOM. As of March 31, 2016, the DICOM rate was approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the DICOM rate of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar.\nAs of March 31, 2016, after the revaluation, AbbVie’s net monetary assets in Venezuela were less than $10 million. The company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether use of the DICOM rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances.\nThe company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain other oil-exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions. Due to the decline in the price of oil, liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables.\nThree U.S. wholesalers accounted for 41% and 51% of total net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and substantially all of AbbVie’s net revenues in the United States are to these three wholesalers. In addition, net governmental receivables outstanding in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain totaled $567 million at March 31, 2016 and $525 million at December 31, 2015.\nHUMIRA ® (adalimumab) is AbbVie’s single largest product and accounted for approximately 60% and 62% of AbbVie’s total net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nIn March 2015, AbbVie entered into the bridge loan in support of the then planned acquisition of Pharmacyclics. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the company’s May 2015 issuance of the senior notes. Interest expense, net in the three months ended March 2015 included $59 million of costs related to the bridge loan.\nShort-term borrowings include commercial paper borrowings of $400 million at both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper borrowings for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.",

Historically, AbbVie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. In late 2015, AbbVie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. AbbVie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. AbbVie has accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. Based on current economic conditions, this change is expected to reduce AbbVie’s net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016. This change had no effect on the 2015 expense and will not affect the measurement of AbbVie’s total benefit obligations as the change in service cost and interest cost will be completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, AbbVie made voluntary contributions of $202 million and $150 million, respectively, primarily to its domestic defined benefit pension plans.",

Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance with respect to post-separation awards for participants. The AbbVie 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted to AbbVie employees under Abbott’s incentive stock program which were adjusted and converted into new Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards immediately prior to the separation.\nStock-based compensation expense related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP was $138 million and $119 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was principally classified in SG&A expenses for all periods presented, with the remainder classified in R&D expenses and cost of products sold.\nStock Options\nStock options awarded pursuant to the 2013 ISP typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is at least equal to 100% of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of the stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9.25 and $9.96, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense attributable to options during each of the periods presented was not material.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for AbbVie stock options held by both AbbVie and Abbott employees for the three months ended March 31, 2016:\n(options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions)\nOptions\nWeighted- average exercise price\nWeighted- average remaining life (in years)\nAggregate intrinsic value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2015\n$\n$\nGranted\nExercised\n)\nLapsed\n)\nOutstanding at March 31, 2016\n$\nExercisable at March 31, 2016\n$\n$\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the exercise price and the company’s closing stock price on the last day of trading for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $102 million and $83 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRSAs & RSUs\nRSAs and RSUs awarded pursuant to the 2013 ISP generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. AbbVie also grants certain performance-based RSAs and RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. Outstanding performance-based RSAs and RSUs awarded prior to 2016 have a five-year term and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period with vesting contingent upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity (ROE) each year. Recipients are entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents as dividends are declared during the vesting term of the award.\nPerformance-based awards granted in 2016 consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period based on AbbVie’s ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs (including performance-based awards) generally is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. Upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three-year performance period and are earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which assists in estimating the probability of achieving the TSR market condition stipulated in the award grant.\nFor purposes of determining stock-based compensation expense, AbbVie periodically evaluates whether the performance conditions will be achieved (excluding the market condition). If such performance conditions are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for the three months ended March 31, 2016 for AbbVie RSA, RSU and performance share awards held by AbbVie and Abbott employees:\n(share units in thousands)\nShare units\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2015\n$\nGranted\nVested\n)\nLapsed\n)\nOutstanding at March 31, 2016\n$\nThe fair market value of RSAs and RSUs vested was $302 million and $310 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2016, $359 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.\nCash Dividends\nOn February 16, 2016, AbbVie paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock. The dividend was declared by the board of directors on October 30, 2015 and represented an increase of approximately 12% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.51 per share. Additionally, on February 18, 2016, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on May 16, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2016.\nOn February 13 and May 15, 2015, AbbVie paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.49 and $0.51 per share of common stock, respectively, which were declared by the board of directors on October 20, 2014 and February 19, 2015, respectively. These dividends represented an increase of nearly 17% and approximately 4%, respectively, over the previous quarterly rates of $0.42 per share and $0.49 per share, respectively.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn October 20, 2014, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately and superseded the previous authorization. The stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open market or private transactions at management’s direction depending on the company’s cash flows, net debt level, and market conditions. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time.\nIn March 2015, the board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase program in anticipation of executing an accelerated share repurchase agreement in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics.\nUnder this share repurchase program, AbbVie repurchased approximately 4 million shares for $250 million in the open market during the three months ended March 31, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, AbbVie settled $300 million of its open market purchases made during the three months ended December 31, 2015. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses, and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie’s remaining stock repurchase authorization was $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2016.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the changes in balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2016:\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nPension and post- employment benefits\nUnrealized gains on marketable equity securities\nHedging activities\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2015\n$\n) $\n)\n$ 47\n$ 40\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n)\n)\nNet losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\n)\n)\nNet current-period other comprehensive income (loss)\n)\n)\nBalance as of March 31, 2016\n$\n) $\n)\n$ 22\n$ —\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $188 million, which was principally due to the impact of the improvement in the Euro in the three months ended March 31, 2016 on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2015:\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nPension and post- employment benefits\nUnrealized gains on marketable equity securities\nHedging activities\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2014\n$\n) $\n) $\n$\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n)\n)\nNet losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\n—\n)\n)\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income\n)\n)\nBalance as of March 31, 2015\n$\n) $\n) $\n$\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2015 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $549 million, which was principally driven by the impact of the weakening of the Euro in the three months ended March 31, 2015 on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets.\nThe table below presents the impact on AbbVie’s condensed consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(in millions) (brackets denote gains)\n2016\n2015\nPension and post-employment benefits\nAmortization of actuarial losses and other (a)\n$\n$\nLess tax benefit\n)\n)\nTotal reclassifications, net of tax\n$\n$\nHedging activities\n(Gains) on designated cash flow hedges (b)\n$\n) $\n)\nLess tax expense\n—\nTotal reclassifications, net of tax\n$\n) $\n)\n(a)\nAmounts were included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 9).\n(b)\nAmounts were included in cost of products sold (see Note 8).",

The effective tax rate in each period differs from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax exemptions and incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities together with the cost of repatriation decisions. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the benefit of the U.S. research and development credit , as well as certain discrete factors and events, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible devaluation loss related to Venezuela.\nDue to the potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, i t is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months up to $15 million. AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement effective on the date of separation, which provides that Abbott is liable for and has indemnified AbbVie against all income tax liabilities for periods prior to the separation.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.\nSeveral pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvay’s 2006 patent litigation involving AndroGel was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement agreement and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. These cases include: (a) four individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) six purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. et al. Following the district court’s dismissal of all plaintiffs’ claims, appellate proceedings led to the reinstatement of the claims regarding the patent litigation settlement, which are proceeding in discovery in the district court. The Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in these lawsuits.\nIn November 2007, GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) filed a lawsuit against Abbott in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Abbott violated federal antitrust and various state laws in connection with the 2003 Norvir re-pricing. In March 2011, a jury found that Abbott did not violate antitrust laws, but breached its license agreement with GSK. In January 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed this verdict and remanded the case for a new trial due to the alleged improper exclusion of a potential juror. The case was returned to the district court in California, but after GSK dismissed its federal antitrust claims, the case was transferred in April 2015 to the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, where pre-trial proceedings are pending. AbbVie assumed the liability for and control of this proceeding in connection with its separation from Abbott.\nLawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by three named direct purchasers of Niaspan and the other brought by ten named end-payor purchasers of Niaspan. The cases are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. The office of the Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in this lawsuit.\nIn September 2014, the FTC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against AbbVie and others, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement with one of those generic companies violates federal antitrust laws. The FTC’s complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s claim regarding the patent litigation settlement. The office of the Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in this lawsuit.\nIn March 2015, the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit, State of Louisiana v. Fournier Industrie et Sante, et al. , against AbbVie, Abbott and affiliated Abbott entities in Louisiana state court. Plaintiff alleges that patent applications and patent litigation filed and other alleged conduct from the early 2000’s and before related to the drug TriCor violated Louisiana state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. In August 2015, the court dismissed the case as time-barred. The state’s appeal of that dismissal is pending.\nIn August 2013, a putative class action lawsuit, Sidney Hillman Health Center of Rochester, et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against AbbVie in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by three healthcare benefit providers alleging violations of Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes and state deceptive business practice and unjust enrichment laws in connection with reimbursements for certain uses of Depakote from 1998 to 2012. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and/or equitable relief and attorneys’ fees.\nIn November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payors who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted include violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. A similar lawsuit, Allied Services Division Welfare Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed in the same court in October 2015 on behalf of the same putative class members and a putative class of consumers.\nProduct liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 3,400 claims are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 185 claims are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nProduct liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Over ninety percent of the approximately 725 claims are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and the rest are pending in various other federal and state courts. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc (Shire) securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie’s proposed transaction with Shire. In March 2016, the court dismissed the case without prejudice, giving plaintiffs until May 2, 2016 to attempt to amend their complaint.\nIn December 2014, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Plans v. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, et al. , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that AbbVie’s directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the approval and termination of AbbVie’s proposed transaction with Shire. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this case in February 2016.",

AbbVie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis, and asthma. In addition to risankizumab, AbbVie also gained rights to an anti-CD40 antibody, BI 655064, currently in Phase 1 development. BI will retain responsibility for further development of BI 655064, and AbbVie may elect to advance the program after completion of certain clinical achievements. The acquired assets include all patents, data, know-how, third-party agreements, regulatory filings, and manufacturing technology related to BI 655066 and BI 655064. In connection with the closing of the transaction in April 2016, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $595 million to BI. Upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $1.6 billion, as well as royalties on net sales.\nThe company concluded that the acquired assets meet the definition of a business and will account for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The company expects to complete a preliminary allocation of the total consideration during the second quarter of 2016, and expects most of the purchase price will be allocated to indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nProposed Acquisition of Stemcentrx, Inc.\nIn April 2016, AbbVie entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Stemcentrx, Inc. (Stemcentrx), a privately held biotechnology company. The transaction will expand AbbVie’s oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications, and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in Stemcentrx for aggregate upfront consideration of approximately $5.8 billion, consisting of 62.5 million shares of AbbVie common stock and approximately $2.0 billion in cash. The holders of Stemcentrx securities will be eligible to receive up to $4.0 billion in additional payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. Upon closing, AbbVie will account for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The company expects most of the purchase price will be allocated to indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIn April 2016, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $4.0 billion increase to AbbVie’s existing share repurchase program. AbbVie intends to execute an accelerated share repurchase program promptly following the closing of the transaction to reacquire all of the newly-issued equity.",

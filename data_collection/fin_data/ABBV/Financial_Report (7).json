                "value": "Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation\nBackground\nThe principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Substantially all of AbbVie’s net revenues in the United States are to three wholesalers. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott’s shareholders (the separation). In connection with the separation, AbbVie and Abbott entered into transition services agreements covering certain corporate support and back office services that AbbVie historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury, and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, engineering support, quality assurance support, and other administrative services. These agreements facilitated the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. The majority of these transition service agreements expired without extension at December 31, 2014; however, some of these services continue to be provided to AbbVie on a temporary basis. The remaining transition services agreements are expected to terminate during 2015.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, AbbVie incurred certain separation-related expenses, which were principally classified in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Separation-related expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $95 million and $110 million, respectively, and were $199 million and $190 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nBasis of Historical Presentation\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIt is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.\nFor a certain portion of AbbVie’s operations, the legal transfer of AbbVie’s assets (net of liabilities) did not occur with the separation of AbbVie on January 1, 2013 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and satisfy other regulatory requirements in certain countries. Under the terms of the separation agreement with Abbott, AbbVie is responsible for the business activities conducted by Abbott on its behalf, and is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. As a result, the related assets and liabilities and results of operations have been reported in AbbVie’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all of these operations have been transferred to AbbVie as of June 30, 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) . The amendments in ASU 2014-09 supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. The core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued, this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. AbbVie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. In July 2015, the FASB voted to amend ASU 2014-09 by approving a one-year deferral of the effective date as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date. Once this new effective date is codified, AbbVie may adopt the new guidance for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 or 2017. AbbVie is currently assessing the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the implementation approach to be used.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted on a retrospective basis.\nAbbVie elected to adopt ASU 2015-03 early, effective in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. As a result, AbbVie reclassified approximately $7 million and $27 million of net deferred financing costs from prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, to a reduction in the carrying amount of its long-term debt as of December 31, 2014. Total debt issuance costs classified as a reduction to long-term debt and lease obligations (current and non-current) were $122 million as of June 30, 2015.",

For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the two-class method was more dilutive. As such, the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs) for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of approximately 3 million shares and 3 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the denominator for the calculation of diluted EPS. These awards otherwise would have been included in the calculation of EPS under the treasury stock method. Additionally, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) allocable to participating securities, including performance-based awards not otherwise included in the calculation of EPS under the treasury stock method, were excluded from the numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method. Earnings allocable to participating securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were $7 million and $11 million, respectively.\nAs further described in Note 10, AbbVie entered into and executed a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (Morgan Stanley) on May 26, 2015, pursuant to which AbbVie paid $5.0 billion for an initial delivery of 68 million shares of AbbVie’s common stock. The initial delivery of shares represented approximately 90% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR, with final settlement expected to occur before the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. For purposes of calculating EPS, AbbVie reflected the ASR as a repurchase of AbbVie common stock and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock. See Note 10 for additional information.\nThe number of common shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans and the ASR that were excluded from the computation of earnings per common share because the effect would have been antidilutive were not material for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.\nFor both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, AbbVie determined the two-class method was more dilutive.

                "value": "Note 4 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\nAcquisition of Pharmacyclics\nOn May 26, 2015, AbbVie acquired Pharmacyclics through a tender offer for approximately $20.8 billion, including cash consideration of $12.4 billion and equity consideration of $8.4 billion. Pharmacyclics is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes novel therapies for people impacted by cancer. Pharmacyclics markets IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, targeting B-cell malignancies. Each outstanding Pharmacyclics share was exchanged for (i) $152.25 in cash and $109.00 in fair market value of AbbVie common stock, (ii) $261.25 in cash, or (iii) $261.25 in fair market value of AbbVie common stock, at the election of each holder, subject to the election and proration of the consideration at 58 percent cash and 42 percent AbbVie common stock.\nThe total consideration for the acquisition of Pharmacyclics was approximately $20.8 billion, consisting of cash and approximately 128 million shares of AbbVie common stock, and is summarized as follows:\n(in millions)\nFair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Pharmacyclics stockholders\n$\nCash consideration paid to Pharmacyclics stockholders\nCash consideration paid to Pharmacyclics equity award holders\nTotal consideration\n$\nThe acquisition of Pharmacyclics has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition has not yet been finalized as of June 30, 2015. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date and may result in significant changes to the recognized assets and liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the May 26, 2015 acquisition date:\n(in millions)\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCash and equivalents\n$\nShort-term investments\nAccounts and other receivables\nInventories\nOther assets\nIntangible assets\nDefinite-lived developed product rights\nDefinite-lived license agreements\nIndefinite-lived research and development\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n)\nOther long-term liabilities\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\nGoodwill\nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\nThe fair market value step-up adjustment to inventories of $462 million will be amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be a period of approximately 18 months.\nIntangible assets relate to the IMBRUVICA developed product rights, acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) in the United States related to additional indications for IMBRUVICA, and the contractual rights to IMBRUVICA profits and losses outside the United States as a result of the collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the collaboration with Janssen. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of 13 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D and identifiable intangible assets was determined using the “income approach,” which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Pharmacyclics includes expected synergies, including the ability to leverage the respective strengths of each business, expanding the combined company’s product portfolio, acceleration of clinical and commercial presence in oncology and establishment of a strong leadership position in hematological oncology. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nFrom the acquisition date through June 30, 2015, AbbVie’s condensed consolidated statements of earnings included net revenues of $107 million and an operating loss of $337 million associated with the acquisition. The operating loss included $226 million of acquisition-related compensation expense, $39 million of inventory step-up and intangible asset amortization, and $89 million of transaction and integration costs. Of these costs, $222 million was recorded within SG&A expense, $93 million within research and development (R&D) expense, and $39 million within cost of products sold.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of AbbVie and Pharmacyclics for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 as if the acquisition of Pharmacyclics had occurred on January 1, 2014:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(in millions, except per share information)\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nNet revenues\n$\n$\n$\n$\nNet earnings\n$\n$\n$\n$\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n$\n$\n$\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n$\n$\n$\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Pharmacyclics. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2014 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with of acquisition-date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition, integration and financing-related costs incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2014. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of the future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition.\nOther Licensing & Acquisitions Activity\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the company recorded IPR&D charges of $23 million and $150 million, respectively. Excluding the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $794 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, and included a $500 million payment to Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) as a result of the satisfaction of certain conditions under the R&D collaboration with Calico for which a charge to IPR&D was recorded in 2014.\nIn March 2015, AbbVie entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C 2 N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders. As part of the agreement, AbbVie made an initial upfront payment of $100 million, which was expensed to IPR&D in the six months ended June 30, 2015. Upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $685 million, as well as royalties on net sales.\nNo material transactions or cash flows related to significant acquisitions and investments were recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2014.

Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $220 million to AbbVie.\nThe collaboration includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, in general, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside the United States. While both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products in the United States, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. Operating expenses for costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of any payments due or reimbursements due from Janssen.

                "value": "Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures\nRisk Management Policy\nThe company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. The company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps, based on judgment, to manage interest costs in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company’s outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required.\nFinancial Instruments\nVarious AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $427 million and $1.4 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2015 will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding twelve months.\nThe company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, AbbVie held notional amounts of $5.5 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nAbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts, designated as fair value hedges, totaling $11.0 billion and $8.0 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie recorded the contracts at fair value and adjusted the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie’s derivative instruments as of June 30, 2015:\nFair value – Derivatives in asset position\nFair value – Derivatives in liability position\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nHedging instruments\nPrepaid expenses and other\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$—\nOthers not designated as hedges\nPrepaid expenses and other\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nn/a\n—\nOther long-term liabilities\nTotal derivatives\n$\n$\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie’s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014:\nFair value – Derivatives in asset position\nFair value – Derivatives in liability position\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nBalance sheet caption\nAmount\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nHedging instruments\nPrepaid expenses and other\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$—\nOthers not designated as hedges\nPrepaid expenses and other\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nn/a\n—\nOther long-term liabilities\nTotal derivatives\n$\n$\nWhile certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company’s counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe unrealized gains/(losses) for the effective portions of the derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income were $(11) million and $9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $76 million and $30 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not significant for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 or 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the location in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and the amount of gain/(loss) recognized into net earnings for derivative instruments, including the effective portions of the gain/(loss) reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into net earnings:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(in millions)\nIncome statement caption\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts —\nDesignated as cash flow hedges\nCost of products sold\n$\n$\n) $\n$\n)\nNot designated as hedges\nNet foreign exchange loss\n)\n)\n)\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\nInterest expense, net\n)\n—\nTotal\n$\n) $\n$\n) $\nThe gain/(loss) related to fair value hedges is recognized in interest expense, net and directly offsets the (loss)/gain on the underlying hedged item, the fixed-rate debt, resulting in no net impact to interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.\nFair Value Measures\nThe fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels:\n·\nLevel 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;\n·\nLevel 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and\n·\nLevel 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at June 30, 2015\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nTime deposits\n—\n—\nEquity securities\n—\n—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nLiabilities\nInterest rate hedges\n$\n$—\n$\n$—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$—\n$\n$—\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at December 31,\n2014\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and equivalents\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nTime deposits\n—\n—\nEquity securities\n—\n—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nLiabilities\nInterest rate hedges\n$\n$—\n$\n$—\nForeign currency contracts\n—\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$—\n$\n$—\nThe fair values for time deposits included in cash and equivalents and short-term investments are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis reflecting quoted market rates for the same or similar instruments. The fair values of time deposits approximate their amortized cost due to the short maturities of these instruments. Available-for-sale equity securities consists of investments for which the fair values are determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company are valued using publicized spot curves for interest rate hedges and publicized forward curves for foreign currency contracts.\nCumulative net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities totaled $12 million and $3 million at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nThere have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels.\nIn addition to the financial instruments that the company is required to recognize at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are shown in the table below:\nBook values\nApproximate fair values\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nJune 30, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n—\n—\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the approximate fair values of the financial instruments as of June 30, 2015:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nFair Value at June 30, 2015\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n$\n$\n$\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n$—\n$—\n$—\n$—\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\n—\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the approximate fair values of the financial instruments as of December 31, 2014:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nFair Value at December 31,\n2014\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n$\n$\n$\nTotal assets\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLiabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n$\n$—\n$\n$—\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and lease obligations\n—\nLong-term debt and lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n—\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n$\n$—\nInvestments consist of cost method investments and held-to-maturity debt securities. Cost method investments include certain investments for which the fair value is determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. To determine the fair value of other cost method investments, the company takes into consideration recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee, which represents a Level 3 basis of fair value measurement. The fair values of held-to-maturity debt securities were estimated based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments. The fair values of short-term and current borrowings approximate the carrying values due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nThe fair values of long-term debt, excluding fair value hedges, were determined by using the published market price for the debt instruments, without consideration of transaction costs, which represents a Level 1 basis of fair value measurement. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions.\nConcentrations of Risk\nThe company invests excess cash in time deposits, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. The company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with deposits with financial institutions. Credit exposure limits have been established to limit a concentration with any single issuer or institution.\nAt June 30, 2015, AbbVie had approximately $260 million of net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (converted at a rate of 6.3 VEF/USD) in its Venezuelan entity, which had net revenues of $51 million and $97 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. If AbbVie’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar had been converted at a rate of 12.8 VEF/USD at June 30, 2015, it would have resulted in a devaluation loss of $132 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether the use of the official rate of 6.3 will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. If circumstances change such that the company concludes it would be appropriate to use a different rate, or if a devaluation of the official rate occurs, it could result in a significant change to AbbVie’s results of operations.\nThree U.S. wholesalers accounted for 47 percent and 49 percent of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and substantially all of AbbVie’s sales in the United States are to these three wholesalers. In addition, net governmental receivables outstanding in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain totaled $514 million at June 30, 2015 and $446 million at December 31, 2014.\nHUMIRA ® (adalimumab) is AbbVie’s single largest product and accounted for approximately 63 percent and 62 percent of AbbVie’s total net revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nIn May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 1.8% senior notes due 2018, $3.75 billion aggregate principal amount of its 2.5% senior notes due 2020, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.2% senior notes due 2022, $3.75 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.6% senior notes due 2025, $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.5% senior notes due 2035 and $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.7% senior notes due 2045. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the offering totaled $93 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The senior notes contain customary covenants, all of which the company remains in compliance with as of June 30, 2015.\nApproximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and approximately $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase agreement with Morgan Stanley. Refer to Notes 4 and 10 for additional information related to the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and the ASR, respectively.\nIn March 2015, AbbVie entered into an $18 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) in support of the planned acquisition of Pharmacyclics. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the company’s May 2015 issuance of the senior notes. Interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 included $27 million and $86 million, respectively, of costs related to the bridge loan.\nShort-term borrowings include commercial paper borrowings of $416 million as of December 31, 2014. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2015. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper borrowings for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2015, AbbVie was in compliance with the financial covenants of its $3.0 billion unsecured credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.",

The AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program, adopted at the time of separation, facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbott’s incentive stock program and authorizes the post-separation grant of several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs, and performance-based RSAs and RSUs.\nIn connection with the separation, outstanding Abbott employee stock options, RSAs, and RSUs previously issued under Abbott’s incentive stock program, were adjusted and converted into new Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards using a formula designed to preserve the intrinsic value and fair value of the awards immediately prior to the separation. Upon the separation on January 1, 2013, holders of Abbott stock options, RSAs, and RSUs, generally received one AbbVie stock-based award for each Abbott stock-based award outstanding. These adjusted awards retained the vesting schedule and expiration date of the original awards. No awards have been granted to Abbott employees other than in connection with the separation.\nStock Options\nThe exercise price for options granted is equal to at least 100 percent of the market value on the date of grant. Stock options typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period.\nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of the stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $9.96 and $9.83, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense attributable to options during each of the periods presented was not material.\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity for both AbbVie and Abbott employees for the six months ended June 30, 2015:\n(options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions)\nOptions\nWeighted- average exercise price\nWeighted- average remaining life (in years)\nAggregate intrinsic value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2014\n$\n$\nGranted\nExercised\n)\nLapsed\n)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2015\n$\nExercisable at June 30, 2015\n$\n$\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the exercise price and the company’s closing stock price on the last day of trading for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $59 million and $39 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $143 million and $111 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2015, $7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.\nRSAs & RSUs\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie RSA and RSU activity (including performance-based awards) for both AbbVie and Abbott employees for the six months ended June 30, 2015:\n(share units in thousands)\nShare units\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2014\n$\nGranted\nVested\n)\nLapsed\n)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2015\n$\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSAs and RSUs (including performance-based awards) is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair market value of RSAs and RSUs vested was $14 million and $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $324 million and $325 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2015, $264 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.\nCash Dividends\nOn June 18, 2015, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.51 per share. The dividend is payable August 14, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2015. Additionally, on February 13 and May 15, 2015, AbbVie paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.49 and $0.51 per share of common stock, respectively, which were declared by the board of directors on October 20, 2014 and February 19, 2015, respectively. The dividends declared on October 20, 2014 and February 19, 2015, represented an increase of nearly 17 percent and approximately 4 percent, respectively, over the previous quarterly rate of $0.42 per share and $0.49 per share, respectively.\nOn February 14, May 15, and August 15, 2014, AbbVie paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.40, $0.42, and $0.42 per share of common stock, respectively, which were declared by the board of directors on December 12, 2013, February 20, 2014, and June 19, 2014 respectively.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn February 15, 2013, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion common stock repurchase program. On October 20, 2014, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately and superseded the previous authorization. This program is expected to be executed over the next several years. The stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open market or private transactions at management’s direction depending on the company’s cash flows, net debt level, and market conditions. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time.\nIn March 2015, the board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase program in anticipation of executing an accelerated share repurchase agreement in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. On May 26, 2015, AbbVie entered into and executed the $5.0 billion ASR with Morgan Stanley. Pursuant to the terms of ASR, Morgan Stanley made an initial delivery of approximately 68 million shares of AbbVie’s common stock on May 27, 2015, which represented approximately 90% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR. AbbVie recorded the aggregate $5.0 billion purchase price as a reduction to stockholders’ equity, consisting of a $4.5 billion increase in common stock held in treasury and a $500 million reduction in additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015. At settlement of the ASR, Morgan Stanley may be required to deliver additional shares of AbbVie’s common stock to AbbVie, or AbbVie may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to Morgan Stanley. The number of shares to be delivered or the amount of such payment shall be based on the difference between the daily volume-weighted average price of AbbVie’s common stock during the term of the ASR and the initial $5.0 billion paid. The final settlement of the ASR is expected to occur before the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and may be accelerated at the option of Morgan Stanley.\nIn addition, AbbVie repurchased approximately 4 million shares for $250 million in the open market during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and approximately 5 million shares for $250 million in the open market during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses, and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie’s remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.4 billion as of June 30, 2015.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the changes in balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax for the six months ended June 30, 2015:\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nPension\nand post- employment benefits\nUnrealized gains on marketable equity\nsecurities\nHedging activities\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2014\n$\n) $\n) $\n$\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n)\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\n—\n)\n)\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income\n)\n)\n)\nBalance as of June 30, 2015\n$\n) $\n$\n$\n$\n)\nOther comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 includes foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $416 million, which was principally driven by the impact of the continued weakening of the Euro in the six months ended June 30, 2015 on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax for the six months ended June 30, 2014:\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nPension\nand post- employment benefits\nUnrealized gains on marketable equity\nsecurities\nHedging activities\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2013\n$\n$\n) $\n$\n) $\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n)\n—\n—\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\n—\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income\n)\n—\nBalance as of June 30, 2014\n$\n$\n) $\n$\n) $\n)\nThe table below presents the significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(in millions) (brackets denote losses)\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nPension and post-employment benefits\nAmortization of actuarial losses and other (a)\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLess tax benefit\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTotal reclassification, net of tax\n$\n$\n$\n$\nHedging activities\n(Gains) losses on designated cash flow hedges (b)\n$\n) $\n$\n) $\nLess tax expense\n—\n—\nTotal reclassification, net of tax\n$\n) $\n$\n) $\n(a) Amounts are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 9).\n(b) Amounts are included in cost of products sold (see Note 8).",

The effective tax rate in each period differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the benefit from foreign operations, which reflects the impact of lower statutory tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax exemptions and incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities together with the cost of repatriation decisions. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings , as well as certain discrete factors and events, including the reversal of previously recognized state valuation allowances of $103 million recorded in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics.\nDue to the potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, i t is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months up to $22 million. AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement effective on the date of separation, which provides that Abbott is liable for and has indemnified AbbVie against all income tax liabilities for periods prior to the separation. Accordingly, Abbott will indemnify and hold AbbVie harmless if the tax positions are settled for amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, and AbbVie will not benefit if prior tax positions are resolved more favorably than recorded amounts.",

                "value": "Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies\nAbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was not significant. Within the next year, initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.\nSeveral pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvay’s 2006 patent litigation involving AndroGel® was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement agreement and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. MDL No. 2084 includes: (a) four individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) six purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al. Following the district court’s dismissal of all plaintiffs’ claims, appellate proceedings led to the reinstatement of the claims regarding the patent litigation settlement, which are proceeding in discovery in the district court. The Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in these lawsuits.\nIn November 2007, GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) filed a lawsuit against Abbott in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Abbott violated federal antitrust and various state laws in connection with the 2003 Norvir® re-pricing. In March 2011, a jury found that Abbott did not violate antitrust laws, but breached its license agreement with GSK. In January 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed this verdict and remanded the case for a new trial due to the alleged improper exclusion of a potential juror. The case was returned to the district court in California, but after GSK dismissed its federal antitrust claims, the case was transferred in April 2015 to the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, where pre-trial proceedings are pending. AbbVie assumed the liability for and control of this proceeding in connection with its separation from Abbott.\nLawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan® entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. Two individual plaintiff lawsuits and 17 purported class actions are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. The office of the Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in this lawsuit.\nIn September 2014, the FTC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against AbbVie and others, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel® was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement with one of those generic companies violates federal antitrust laws. The FTC’s complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s claim regarding the patent litigation settlement and the FTC is seeking reconsideration of that dismissal. The office of the Attorney General of the State of Alaska has served AbbVie with a Civil Investigative Demand, primarily seeking documents that AbbVie produced in this lawsuit.\nIn March 2015, the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit, State of Louisiana v. Fournier Industrie et Sante, et al. , against AbbVie, Abbott and affiliated Abbott entities in Louisiana state court. Plaintiff alleges that patent applications and patent litigation filed and other alleged conduct from the early 2000’s and before related to the drug TriCor® violated Louisiana state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees.\nIn August 2013, a putative class action lawsuit, Sidney Hillman Health Center of Rochester, et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against AbbVie in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by three healthcare benefit providers alleging violations of Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes and state deceptive business practice and unjust enrichment laws in connection with reimbursements for certain uses of Depakote® from 1998 to 2012. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and/or equitable relief and attorneys’ fees. In April 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court’s decision to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice on statute of limitations grounds. The case has been returned to the district court for further proceedings.\nIn November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third-party payors who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel®. The claims asserted include violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nProduct liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 1250 cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the Multi-District Litigation Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 50 cases are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nProduct liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote®. Over ninety percent of the approximately 700 claims are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and the rest are pending in various other federal and state courts. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie’s proposed transaction with Shire. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nIn December 2014, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Plans v. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, et al. , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that AbbVie’s directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Shire transaction approval and termination. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for AbbVie, among other relief.\nAbbVie is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ritonavir/lopinavir tablets (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Kaletra®). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in March 2009, AbbVie alleges that Matrix Laboratories, Inc.’s, Matrix Laboratories, Ltd.’s, and Mylan, Inc.’s proposed generic products infringe AbbVie’s patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Upon Matrix’s motion in November 2009, the court granted a five-year stay of the litigation unless good cause to lift the stay is shown. On July 1, 2014, the stay was lifted pursuant to the original terms of the court order entered in 2009. In February 2015, in a related case filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, AbbVie alleges that Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s, Mylan Laboratories, Ltd.’s and Mylan Laboratories, Inc.’s proposed generic lopinavir/ritonavir products infringe additional AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\nAbbVie is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ritonavir tablets (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Norvir®). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in October 2014, AbbVie alleges that Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc.’s proposed generic ritonavir tablets product infringes AbbVie’s patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\nAs previously disclosed, AbbVie sought to enforce its patent rights relating to testosterone gel (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark AndroGel® 1.62%). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in February 2013, AbbVie alleged that Perrigo Company’s and Perrigo Israel Pharmaceutical Ltd.’s proposed generic product infringed AbbVie’s patents and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On April 28, 2015, AbbVie and Perrigo entered into a settlement and license agreement, the terms of which are confidential. The litigation was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.",

                "value": "1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the Company’s 2016 Annual Report). The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On March 13, 2017, the Company announced an agreement to acquire Simply Business from Aquiline Capital Partners LLC for total consideration of approximately $490 million, which includes the repayment of debt and other obligations at the completion of the transaction. Simply Business is a leading digital provider of insurance policies to small businesses in the United Kingdom, offering products online on behalf of a broad panel of carriers. The Company expects to fund the transaction, subject to market conditions, through a combination of debt financing and internal resources. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Adoption of Accounting Standards Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post retirement cost (net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees. The update requires that the employer service cost component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other components (non-service costs) be presented separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented. The update also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets when applicable. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The update is to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service cost and non-service cost and prospectively with respect to applying the service cost only eligible for capitalization in assets guidance. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 11 which has been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statement of income in which such amounts are reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being eligible for capitalization in assets was not applicable. For information regarding accounting standards that the Company adopted during the years presented, see the “Adoption of Accounting Standards ” Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted For information regarding accounting standards that the Company has not yet adopted, see the “Other Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ” Nature of Operations For the periods presented in these financial statements, the Company was organized into three reportable business segments: Business and International Insurance; Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance. These segments reflected the manner in which the Company’s businesses were managed and represented an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business was marketed and the manner in which risks were underwritten. For more information regarding the Company’s business segment structure in effect for the periods presented in these financial statements, see the “ Effective April 1, 2017, the Company’s results will be reported in the following three business segments — Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company’s businesses will be managed. While the segmentation of the Company’s domestic businesses will be unchanged, the Company’s international businesses, which were previously reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, will now be disaggregated among these three newly aligned business segments. The newly aligned segments will be presented in the Company’s financial statements beginning with the period ending June 30, 2017, and prior periods presented therein will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation.",

                "value": "4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: · - · - · - Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. While the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was $179 million and $99 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a broker quote was $83 million and $85 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. For more information regarding the valuation of the Company’s fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Fair Value Hierarchy The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Contingencies The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company’s properties is subject are described below. Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods. Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity. Gain Contingency On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al. On November 7, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement with one of the three defendants then remaining in this dispute. The Company received payment under the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2016 and, as a result, recognized a $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) gain in the fourth quarter, which was included in “other revenues” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The reinsurance recoverable balance related to this case was reduced from approximately $238 million to approximately $31 million in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. On December 22, 2016, the Appellate Court, First Department affirmed the denial of the reinsurers’ motion to change venue and a trial is set to proceed on May 1, 2017 with regard to the remaining two defendants — both of which are subsidiaries of the same company. At March 31, 2017, the claim related to the remaining defendants totaled $71 million, comprising the $31 million of reinsurance recoverable plus interest amounting to $40 million as of that date. Interest will continue to accrue at an annual rate of 9% until the amounts owed by the remaining defendants are paid, though the reinsurers still party to the case contested that interest is owed in a brief filed on June 6, 2016. The interest that would be owed as part of any judgment ultimately entered in favor of the Company related to the remaining defendants is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with FASB Topic 450, Contingencies, Other Commitments and Guarantees Commitments Investment Commitments Guarantees The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $358 million at March 31, 2017, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.

AND SUBSIDIARIES The following consolidating financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. These consolidating financial statements have been prepared from the Company’s financial information on the same basis of accounting as the consolidated financial statements. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries, TRV) has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC), which totaled $700 million at March 31, 2017. Prior to the merger of TPC and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. in 2004, TPC fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. (TIGHI). Concurrent with the merger, TRV fully and unconditionally assumed such guarantee obligations of TPC. TPC is deemed to have no assets or operations independent of TIGHI. Consolidating financial information for TIGHI has not been presented herein because such financial information would be substantially the same as the financial information provided for TPC.

                "value": "Adoption of Accounting Standards Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post retirement cost (net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees. The update requires that the employer service cost component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other components (non-service costs) be presented separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented. The update also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets when applicable. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The update is to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service cost and non-service cost and prospectively with respect to applying the service cost only eligible for capitalization in assets guidance. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 11 which has been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statement of income in which such amounts are reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being eligible for capitalization in assets was not applicable.

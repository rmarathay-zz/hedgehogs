                "value": "1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the Company’s 2014 Annual Report). The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Adoption of Accounting Standards Updates Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued revised guidance to reduce diversity in practice for reporting discontinued operations. Under the previous guidance, any component of an entity that was a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary or an asset group was eligible for discontinued operations presentation. The revised guidance only allows disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift (e.g., disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity) and that have a major effect on a reporting entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. The revised guidance also requires expanded disclosure in the financial statements for discontinued operations as well as for disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. The updated guidance was effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation accounting guidance. The update is in response to accounting complexity concerns, particularly from the asset management industry. The guidance simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of approaches to consolidation, provides a scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds and ends the indefinite deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. The updated guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the required presentation of debt issuance costs. The amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the recognized debt liability, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. Amortization of debt issuance costs is to be reported as interest expense. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the updated guidance. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance is consistent with the Company’s accounting policy and its adoption will not have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period’s financial statements, th Additional Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the updated guidance on revenue recognition by one year to the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. For additional information regarding Revenue from Contracts with Customers ” Nature of Operations The Company is organized into three reportable business segments: Business and International Insurance; Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance. These segments reflect the manner in which the Company’s businesses are currently managed and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten.

Derivative Financial Instruments From time to time, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury note futures contracts to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the investment portfolio. U.S. Treasury futures contracts require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had $450 million and $350 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts, respectively.

                "value": "4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: · - · - · - Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. While the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was $177 million and $92 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a broker quote was $93 million and $140 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. For more information regarding the valuation of the Company’s fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Fair Value Hierarchy The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Contingencies The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company’s properties is subject are described below. Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods. Settlement of Asbestos Direct Action Litigation In January 2015, pursuant to an order issued by the federal bankruptcy court, the Company made a payment in the amount of $579 million for the settlement of litigation that had commenced in 2001 related to the handling and settlement of asbestos claims. The payment was fully accrued in the Company’s financial statements at December 31, 2014 and was comprised of the $502 million settlement amounts, plus pre- and post-judgment interest totaling $77 million. For further information related to this litigation, see “Settlement of Asbestos Direct Action Litigation” in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report. Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity. Gain Contingency On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al. Contingencies, Other Commitments and Guarantees Commitments Investment Commitments Guarantees The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $454 million at September 30, 2015, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable was $150 million at September 30, 2015, approximately $75 million of which is indemnified by a third party. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480 million at September 30, 2015, all of which is indemnified by a third party. For more information regarding Company guarantees, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report.",

These consolidating financial statements have been prepared from the Company’s financial information on the same basis of accounting as the consolidated financial statements. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries, TRV) has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of Travelers Property Casualty Corp.

These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the Company’s 2014 Annual Report). The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.",

Under the previous guidance, any component of an entity that was a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary or an asset group was eligible for discontinued operations presentation. The revised guidance only allows disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift (e.g., disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity) and that have a major effect on a reporting entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. The revised guidance also requires expanded disclosure in the financial statements for discontinued operations as well as for disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. The updated guidance was effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

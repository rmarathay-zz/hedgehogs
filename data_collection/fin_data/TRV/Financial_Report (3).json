                "value": "1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Company’s 2015 Annual Report). The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Adoption of Accounting Standards Compensation — Stock Compensation: Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning employee share-based payments that contain performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period. The updated guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target that affects vesting should not be reflected in estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which service has been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for which requisite service has not yet been rendered is recognized prospectively over the remaining service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity In November 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify when the separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract. Specifically, the updated guidance clarifies that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation accounting guidance. The update is in response to accounting complexity concerns, particularly from the asset management industry. The guidance simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of approaches to consolidation, provides a scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds and ends the indefinite deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Interest — Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the required presentation of debt issuance costs. The updated guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the recognized debt liability, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. Amortization of debt issuance costs is to be reported as interest expense. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the updated guidance. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The updated guidance is consistent with the Company’s accounting policy and its adoption did not have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period’s financial statements, th Compensation — In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions as follows: Accounting for Income Taxes Under current accounting guidance, if the deduction for a share-based payment award for tax purposes exceeds, or is less than, the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, the resulting excess tax benefit, or tax deficiency, is reported as part of additional paid-in capital. Under the updated guidance, these excess tax benefits, or tax deficiencies, are reported as part of income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The updated guidance also removes the requirement to delay recognition of any excess tax benefit when there are no current taxes payable to which the benefit would be applied. The tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are to be included with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than being reported separately as a financing activity. Forfeitures The updated guidance permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures when they occur or continue to apply the current method of accruing the compensation cost based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Requirements The updated guidance changes the threshold amount an entity can withhold for taxes when settling an equity award and still qualify for equity classification. A company can withhold up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the employees’ applicable jurisdiction rather than withholding up to the employers’ minimum statutory withholding requirement. The update also clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for withheld shares are to be presented in financing activities on the statement of cash flows. Transition The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period; if early adoption is elected, the entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same reporting period and reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2016. With respect to the forfeiture accounting policy election, the Company elected to retain its policy of accruing the compensation cost based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The adoption did not result in any cumulative effect adjustments or restatement and did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to require lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability for leases with terms of more than 12 months. The updated guidance retains the two classifications of a lease as either an operating or finance lease (previously referred to as a capital lease). Both lease classifications require the lessee to record the right-to-use asset and the lease liability based upon the present value of cash flows. Finance leases will reflect the financial arrangement by recognizing interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization expense of the right-to-use asset. Operating leases will recognize lease expense (with no separate recognition of interest expense) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The accounting by lessors is not significantly changed by the updated guidance. The updated guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and will require that the earliest comparative period presented include the measurement and recognition of existing leases with an adjustment to equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument is contingently exercisable, the event that triggers the ability to exercise the option is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt instrument (i.e., the economic characteristics and risks of the option are related to interest rates or credit risks) and the entity does not have to assess whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Financial Instruments — Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the accounting for credit losses for financial instruments. The updated guidance applies a new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or CECL) for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. reinsurance recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. The updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on the financial instruments currently held by the Company, there would not be a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity if the new guidance were able to be adopted in the current accounting period. The impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance will be determined by the financial instruments held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

Derivative Financial Instruments From time to time, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury note futures contracts to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the investment portfolio. U.S. Treasury futures contracts require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts.

                "value": "4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: · - · - · - Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. While the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was $146 million and $101 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a broker quote was $73 million and $117 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. For more information regarding the valuation of the Company’s fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Fair Value Hierarchy The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that the Company used to determine its projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the projected cash flows related to service and interest costs. Previously, the Company estimated these service and interest cost components by applying a single weighted-average discount rate derived from this yield curve. This change was made to provide a better estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs, consistent with the methodology used to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans. This change did not affect the measurement of the Company’s total benefit obligations, as the change in service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period. The change reduced the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs by $1 million and $8 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and by $4 million and $23 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The weighted average discount rates that are being used to measure service and interest costs during 2016 are 4.77% and 3.64%, respectively, for the domestic qualified pension plan, 4.53% and 3.47%, respectively, for the domestic nonqualified pension plan and 0.00% and 3.53%, respectively, for the domestic postretirement benefit plan. The discount rate associated with the service cost component of the domestic postretirement benefit plan is zero as it is a closed plan and all participants are fully vested. Under the Company’s prior estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for both the service and interest cost components would have been 4.50% for the domestic qualified pension plan, 4.37% for the domestic nonqualified pension plan and 4.35% for the domestic postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, is recognizing the effect prospectively beginning in 2016.",

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Contingencies The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company’s properties is subject are described below. Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods. In the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $82 million and $72 million, respectively. In the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net asbestos reserves by $225 million and $224 million, respectively. Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity. Gain Contingency On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al. Contingencies, Other Commitments and Guarantees Commitments Investment Commitments Guarantees The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $391 million at September 30, 2016, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable was $150 million at September 30, 2016, approximately $75 million of which is indemnified by a third party. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480 million at September 30, 2016, all of which is indemnified by a third party.

All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Company’s 2015 Annual Report). The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period.

                "value": "Adoption of Accounting Standards Compensation — Stock Compensation: Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning employee share-based payments that contain performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period. The updated guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target that affects vesting should not be reflected in estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which service has been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for which requisite service has not yet been rendered is recognized prospectively over the remaining service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity In November 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify when the separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract. Specifically, the updated guidance clarifies that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation accounting guidance. The update is in response to accounting complexity concerns, particularly from the asset management industry. The guidance simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of approaches to consolidation, provides a scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds and ends the indefinite deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Interest — Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the required presentation of debt issuance costs. The updated guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the recognized debt liability, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. Amortization of debt issuance costs is to be reported as interest expense. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the updated guidance. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The updated guidance is consistent with the Company’s accounting policy and its adoption did not have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period’s financial statements, th Compensation — In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions as follows: Accounting for Income Taxes Under current accounting guidance, if the deduction for a share-based payment award for tax purposes exceeds, or is less than, the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, the resulting excess tax benefit, or tax deficiency, is reported as part of additional paid-in capital. Under the updated guidance, these excess tax benefits, or tax deficiencies, are reported as part of income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The updated guidance also removes the requirement to delay recognition of any excess tax benefit when there are no current taxes payable to which the benefit would be applied. The tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are to be included with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than being reported separately as a financing activity. Forfeitures The updated guidance permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures when they occur or continue to apply the current method of accruing the compensation cost based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Requirements The updated guidance changes the threshold amount an entity can withhold for taxes when settling an equity award and still qualify for equity classification. A company can withhold up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the employees’ applicable jurisdiction rather than withholding up to the employers’ minimum statutory withholding requirement. The update also clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for withheld shares are to be presented in financing activities on the statement of cash flows. Transition The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period; if early adoption is elected, the entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same reporting period and reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2016. With respect to the forfeiture accounting policy election, the Company elected to retain its policy of accruing the compensation cost based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The adoption did not result in any cumulative effect adjustments or restatement and did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

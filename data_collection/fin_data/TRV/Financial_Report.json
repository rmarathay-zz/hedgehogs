                "value": "1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the Company’s 2016 Annual Report) as updated by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 20, 2017. The Form 8-K was filed to reclassify certain of the Company’s historical segment information to conform the presentation of such segment information to the manner in which the Company’s businesses have been managed beginning April 1, 2017 (as described in more detail below) and reflect the revised names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising these segments and other related changes. The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings LTD (Simply Business), a leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million, which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to certain employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 50% of the restricted stock will vest two years from the issuance date and the remainder will vest three years from the issuance date. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail in note 8) and internal resources to fund this transaction. Adoption of Accounting Standards Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post retirement cost (net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees. The update requires that the employer service cost component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other components (non-service costs) be presented separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented. The update also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets when applicable. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The update is to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service cost and non-service cost and prospectively with respect to applying the service cost only eligible for capitalization in assets guidance. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 12 which has been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statement of income in which such amounts are reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being eligible for capitalization in assets was not applicable. For information regarding accounting standards that the Company adopted during the years presented, see the “Adoption of Accounting Standards ” Compensation — Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting In May 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance related to a change to the terms or conditions (modification) of a share-based payment award. The updated guidance provides that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value and vesting conditions of the modified award and the classification of the modified award (equity or liability instrument) are the same as the original award immediately before the modification. The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The update is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted in any interim periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective April 1, 2017. The adoption did not have an effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted For information regarding accounting standards that the Company has not yet adopted, see the “Other Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ” Nature of Operations Effective April 1, 2017, and as reported in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company’s results are reported in the following three business segments — Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company’s businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company’s domestic businesses was unchanged, the Company’s international businesses, which were previously managed and reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by product type among the three newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company revised the names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company’s segments and has reflected other related changes. The reportable business segments are as follows: Business Insurance Business Insurance offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance related services to its customers, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Brazil and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s. Business Insurance is comprised of Select Accounts, Middle Market, National Accounts, National Property and Other, and International. Business Insurance also includes Simply Business, as well as Business Insurance Other, which comprises the Special Liability Group (which manages the Company’s asbestos and environmental liabilities) and the assumed reinsurance and certain other runoff operations. Bond & Specialty Insurance Bond & Specialty Insurance provides surety, fidelity, management liability, professional liability, and other property and casualty coverages and related risk management services to its customers in the United States and certain specialty insurance products in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, utilizing various degrees of financially-based underwriting approaches. Personal Insurance Personal Insurance writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals’ personal risks, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada. The primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.",

These credit losses represent less than 1% of the fixed maturity portfolio on a pre-tax basis and less than 1% of shareholders’ equity on an after-tax basis at both dates. There were no significant changes in the credit component of OTTI during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 from that disclosed in note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report as updated by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 20, 2017. Derivative Financial Instruments From time to time, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury note futures contracts to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the investment portfolio. U.S. Treasury futures contracts require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. At both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Net realized investment losses related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were not significant.",

                "value": "4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: · - · - · - Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. While the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was $123 million and $99 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a broker quote was $75 million and $85 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. For more information regarding the valuation of the Company’s fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Fair Value Hierarchy The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

Prior Year Reserve Development The following disclosures regarding reserve development are on a “net of reinsurance” basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $197 million and $430 million, respectively, of net favorable development for claims arising in prior years, including $299 million and $507 million, respectively, of net favorable prior year reserve development impacting the Company’s results of operations and $38 million of accretion of discount in each period. Business Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first nine months of 2017 totaled $195 million, primarily driven by net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s domestic operations due to better than expected loss experience in (i) the workers’ compensation product line for multiple accident years, (ii) the general liability product line (excluding an increase to asbestos and environmental reserves) for both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years and (iii) the commercial multi-peril product line for liability coverages for multiple accident years, partially offset by (iv) a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves, (v) a $65 million increase to environmental reserves and (vi) the impact of higher than expected loss experience in the commercial automobile product line for accident years 2013 through 2016. The net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s domestic operations was partially offset by net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s international operations in Europe due to the U.K. Ministry of Justice’s “Ogden” discount rate adjustment applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first nine months of 2016 totaled $203 million, primarily driven by net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s domestic operations due to better than expected loss experience in (i) the workers’ compensation product line for accident years 2006 and prior as well as accident year 2015, (ii) the general liability product line (excluding an increase to asbestos and environmental reserves) for both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years and (iii) the commercial automobile product line for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by (iv) a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves and (v) an $82 million increase to environmental reserves, as well as net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s international operations in Bond & Specialty Insurance.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Contingencies The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company’s properties is subject are described below. Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods. Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity. Gain Contingency On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al. On November 7, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement with one of the three defendants then remaining in this dispute. The Company received payment under the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2016 and, as a result, recognized a $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) gain in the fourth quarter, which was included in “other revenues” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with that settlement, the reinsurance recoverable balance related to this case was reduced from approximately $238 million to approximately $31 million in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2017, the claim related to the remaining defendants totaled $71 million, comprising the $31 million of reinsurance recoverable plus interest amounting to $40 million as of that date. The interest was treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with FASB Topic 450, Contingencies On May 1, 2017, the Company agreed to a settlement of this dispute with the two remaining defendants, along with the settlement of several other disputes with these same parties. As a result of the settlement of all of these matters, the Company recorded an immaterial gain in “other revenues” in its consolidated statement of income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and the reinsurance recoverable of $31 million in the Company’s balance sheet was fully satisfied. Other Commitments and Guarantees Commitments Investment Commitments Guarantees The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $358 million at September 30, 2017, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable was $45 million at September 30, 2017, approximately $23 million of which is indemnified by a third party. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480 million at September 30, 2017, all of which is indemnified by a third party. For more information regarding Company guarantees, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report as updated by the Company’s Form 8-K filed on June 20, 2017.",

                "value": "Basis of Presentation The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the Company’s 2016 Annual Report) as updated by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 20, 2017. The Form 8-K was filed to reclassify certain of the Company’s historical segment information to conform the presentation of such segment information to the manner in which the Company’s businesses have been managed beginning April 1, 2017 (as described in more detail below) and reflect the revised names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising these segments and other related changes. The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings LTD (Simply Business), a leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million, which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to certain employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 50% of the restricted stock will vest two years from the issuance date and the remainder will vest three years from the issuance date. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail in note 8) and internal resources to fund this transaction.",

                "value": "Adoption of Accounting Standards Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post retirement cost (net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees. The update requires that the employer service cost component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other components (non-service costs) be presented separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented. The update also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets when applicable. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The update is to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service cost and non-service cost and prospectively with respect to applying the service cost only eligible for capitalization in assets guidance. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 12 which has been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statement of income in which such amounts are reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being eligible for capitalization in assets was not applicable. For information regarding accounting standards that the Company adopted during the years presented, see the “Adoption of Accounting Standards ” Compensation — Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting In May 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance related to a change to the terms or conditions (modification) of a share-based payment award. The updated guidance provides that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value and vesting conditions of the modified award and the classification of the modified award (equity or liability instrument) are the same as the original award immediately before the modification. The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The update is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted in any interim periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective April 1, 2017. The adoption did not have an effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

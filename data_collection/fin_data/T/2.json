PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one q uarter of our period end. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generall y accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Income Taxes As of January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-16, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d (ASU 2016-16), with modified retrospective application, resulting in our recognition of an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings. Under ASU 2016-16, we recognize the income tax effects of the intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory (e.g., intellectual property or property, plant and equipment) during the period of int ercompany sale or transfer instead of the period of either the sale or transfer to a third party or recognition of depreciation or impairment. New Accounting Standards Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Stan dards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2017-07, \u201cCompensation \u2013 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d (ASU 2017-07), which changes the presentation of periodic bene fit cost components . Under ASU 2017-07, we will continue to present service costs within our operating expenses but present amortization of prior service credits and other components of our net periodic benefit cost in \u201cother income (expense)\u201d in our conso lidated statements of income. ASU 2017-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. See Note 5 for our components of net periodic benefit cost. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASC 606) , and has modified the standard thereafter. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements . ASC 606, as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard using the \u201cmodified retrospective method.\u201d Under that method, we will apply the rules to all contracts exi sting as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous accounting standards.",

                "value": "NOTE 4. SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our segments based on Segment Contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items (as discussed below), and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Business Solutions, (2) Entertainment Group, (3) Consumer Mobility and (4) International. We also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as Segment Contribution excluding equity in ne t income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that managem ent uses to evaluate segment operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divide d by total revenues. The Business Solutions segment provides services to business customers, including multinational companies; governmental and wholesale customers; and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through employer-sponsored plan s. We provide advanced IP-based services including Virtual Private Networks (VPN); Ethernet-related products and broadband, collectively referred to as fixed strategic services; as well as traditional data and voice products. We utilize our wireless and wi red networks to provide a complete communications solution to our business customers. The Entertainment Group segment provides video, internet, voice communication, and interactive and targeted advertising services to customers located in the United States or in U.S. territories. We utilize our copper and IP-based wired network and/or our satellite technology. The Consumer Mobility segment provides nationwide wireless service to consumers, wholesale and resale wirel ess subscribers located in the United States or in U.S. territories. We utilize our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet, video and home monitoring services over wireless devices. The International segment provides ent ertainment services in Latin America and wireless services in Mexico. Video entertainment services are provided to primarily residential customers using satellite technology. We ut ilize our regional and national networks in Mexico to provide consu mer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. Our international subsidiaries conduct business in their local currency, and operating results are converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates. In reconciling ite ms to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, Corporate and Other includes: (1) operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, and (2) im pacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Certain operating items are not allocated to our bus iness segments, and those include: Acquisition-related items which consists of (1) items associated with the merger and integration of acquired businesses and (2) the noncash amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Certain significant i tems which consists of (1) noncash actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, (2) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (3) losses resulting from abandonment or impairment of assets a nd (4) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. I nterest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Our operating assets are utilized by multiple segments and consist of our wireless and wired networks as well as our satellite fleet. We manage our assets to provide for the most efficient, effective and integrated service to our customers, not by segment , and, therefore, asset information and capital expenditures by segment are not presented.

We also provide certain medical, dental, life insurance and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1 974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC, the primary holdi ng company for our domestic wireless business, to the trust used to pay pension benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a value of $8,426 at March 31, 2017. The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distribution s of $560 per annum, which are distributed quarterly by AT&T Mobility II LLC to the trust, in equal amounts and accounted for as contributions. We distributed $140 to the trust during the three months ended March 31, 2017. So long as we make the distributi ons, we will have no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan\u2019s separate financial statements. However, because the preferred equ ity interest is not unconditionally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and p ostretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. The following table details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompa nying consolidated statements of income. A portion of these expenses is capitalized as part of internal construction projects, providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded. Service costs and prior service credits are reported in our segment resu lts while interest costs and expected return on plan assets are included with Corporate and Other (see Note 4). Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Pension cost: Service cost \u2013 benefits earned during the period $ 282 $ 278 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 484 495 Expected return on assets (783) (778) Amortization of prior service credit (31) (26) Net pension (credit) cost $ (48) $ (31) Postretirement cost: Service cost \u2013 benefits earned during the period $ 41 $ 48 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 222 243 Expected return on assets (80) (89) Amortization of prior service credit (336) (319) Net postretirement (credit) cost $ (153) $ (117) Combined net pension and postretirement (credit) cost $ (201) $ (148) The decrease in the combined net pension and postretirement costs in the first quarter reflects higher amortization of prior service credits due to plan changes, including changes to future costs for continued retiree healthcare coverage. The reduction also reflects decreasing corporate bond rates, which contributed to lower interest costs. We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans. For the first quar ter ended 201 7 and 201 6 , net supplemental pension benefits costs not included in the table above were $ 22 and $ 23 . ",

            "Fair Value Measurements And Disclosure": {
                "value": "NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets o r liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in in active markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation method ology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurements level of an asset or liability within the fair value hie rarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodolog ies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2016 . Long-Term Debt and Ot her Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures 1 $ 132,379 $ 138,944 $ 122,381 $ 128,726 Bank borrowings 3 3 4 4 Investment securities 2,640 2,640 2,587 2,587 1 Includes credit agreement borrowings. The carrying amount of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 : March 31, 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,253 $ - $ - $ 1,253 International equities 639 - - 639 Fixed income bonds - 501 - 501 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 62 - 62 Cross-currency swaps - 235 - 235 Liability Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - (20) - (20) Cross-currency swaps - (3,635) - (3,635) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. December 31, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,215 $ - $ - $ 1,215 International equities 594 - - 594 Fixed income bonds - 508 - 508 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 79 - 79 Cross-currency swaps - 89 - 89 Liability Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - (14) - (14) Cross-currency swaps - (3,867) - (3,867) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealize d gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying bas is of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 236 have maturities of less than one year, $ 58 within one to three years, $ 47 within three to five years and $ 160 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments a nd nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative transactions to manage cer tain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivat ives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fa ir value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps witho ut exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as ass ets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense. In the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 , no ineffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated fr om the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign currency denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amount s, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign currency-denominated rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate. Un realized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 , no ineffectiveness wa s measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during th e period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a m aterial amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 59 from accumulated OCI to in terest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction aff ects earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. In the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds ba sed on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At March 31, 2017 , we had posted collateral of $2,846 (a deposit asset) and held no collateral . Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Ratings, before the final collateral exchange in March , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 123 . If DIRECTV Holdings LLC\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P), we would have been required to post additional collateral of $2 46 . At December 31, 2016 , we had posted collateral of $3,242 (a deposit asset) and held no collateral . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments. Following are the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions: March 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Interest rate swaps $ 10,450 $ 9,650 Cross-currency swaps 29,642 29,642 Total $ 40,092 $ 39,292 Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance: Effect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value Hedging Relationships Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Interest rate swaps (Interest expense): Gain (Loss) on interest rate swaps $ (25) $ 66 Gain (Loss) on long-term debt 25 (66) In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the quarter ended March 31 were offset against interest expense.

On October 22, 2016, we entered into and announced a merger agreement (Merger Agreement) to acquire Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner) in a 50% cash and 50% stock transaction for $107.50 per share of Time Warner common stock, or approximately $85,400 at the date of the announcement (Merger). Combined with Time Warner\u2019s net debt at December 31, 2016, the total transaction value is approximately $10 8,200. Each share of Time Warner common stock will be exchanged for $53.75 per share in cash and a number of shares of AT&T common stock equal to the exchange ratio. If the average stock price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at the time of closing the Merger is between (or equal to) $37.411 and $41.349 per share, the exchange ratio will be the quotient of $53.75 divided by the average stock price. If the average stock price is greater than $41.349, the exchange ratio will be 1.300. If the average stock price is less than $37.411, the exchange ratio will be 1.437. Post-transaction, Time Warner shareholders will own between 14.4% and 15.7% of AT&T shares on a fully-diluted basis based on the number of AT&T shares outstanding. The cash portion of the purch ase price will be financed with new debt and cash. Time Warner is a global leader in media and entertainment whose major businesses encompass an array of some of the most respected and successful media brands. The deal combines Time Warner\u2019s vast library of content and ability to create new premium content for audiences around the world with our extensive customer relationships and distribution, one of the world\u2019s largest pay-TV subscriber bases and leading scale in TV, mobile and broadband distribution. The Merger Agreement was approved by Time Warner shareholders on February 15, 2017 and remains subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has stated that it does not believe it will need to review the d eal as no licenses are involved. It is also a condition to closing that necessary consents from foreign governmental entities must be obtained. The transaction is expected to close before year-end 2017. If the Merger is terminated as a result of reaching t he termination date (and at that time one or more of the conditions relating to certain regulatory approvals have not been satisfied) or there is a final, non-appealable order preventing the transaction relating to antitrust laws, communications laws, util ities laws or foreign regulatory laws, then under certain circumstances, we would be obligated to pay Time Warner $500. Auction 1000 On April 13, 2017, the FCC announced that we were the successful bidder for $910 of spectrum in 18 markets. We provided t he FCC an initial deposit of $2,348 in July 2016 and received a refund of $1,438 in April 2017. Other Events FirstNet On March 30, 2017, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) announced its selection of AT& T to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America\u2019s first responders. FirstNet expects to provide 20 MHz of valuable telecommunications spectrum and success-based payments of $6,500 over the next five years to support networ k buildout. The actual reach of the network and our investment over the 25-year period will be determined by the number of individual states electing to participate in FirstNet. We do not expect FirstNet to materially impact our 2017 results given the timi ng of the state opt-in process.",

As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, gross equipment installment receivables of $ 4,119 and $5,665 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 2,346 and $ 3,425 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable - net.\u201d In 2014, we entered into an uncommitted agreement pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank and various other relationship b anks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under this agreement, we transferred certain receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price. Under the te rms of the agreement, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the Purchasers. Since inception, cash proceeds received, net of remittances (excluding amounts returned as deferred purchase price), were $ 3, 740 . The follow ing table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Gross receivables sold $ 2,846 $ 2,482 Net receivables sold 1 2,621 2,256 Cash proceeds received 1,432 1,521 Deferred purchase price recorded 1,189 719 1 Receivables net of allowance, imputed interest and trade-in right guarantees. The deferred purchase price is initially recorded at estimated fair value, which is based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected, adjusted by the expected timing and value of device trade-ins, and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used are considered Leve l 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6). The following table shows the equipment installment receivables, previously sold to the Purchasers, which we repurchased in exchange for the associated deferred purchase price dur ing the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Fair value of repurchased receivables $ 377 $ 532 Carrying value of deferred purchase price 339 539 Gain (loss) on repurchases 1 $ 38 $ (7) 1 These gains (losses) are included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our deferred purchase price receivable was $3,813 and $3,090, respectively, of which $2,049 and $1,606 are included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the amount of our deferred purchase price at any point in time. The sales of equipment installment receivables did not have a material impac t on our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the cash flows related to the arrangement as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale of the receivables and the collection of the deferred purchase price is not subject to significant interest rate risk. Derecognized Installment Receivables The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables that were sold to Purchasers and are no longer considered our assets. 2017 Outstanding derecognized receivables at January 1, $ 7,232 Gross receivables sold 2,846 Collections on cash purchase price (1,128) Collections on deferred purchase price (185) Fees (23) Trade ins and other (73) Fair value of repurchased receivables (377) Outstanding derecognized receivables at March 31, $ 8,292",

PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one q uarter of our period end. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generall y accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Income Taxes As of January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-16, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d (ASU 2016-16), with modified retrospective application, resulting in our recognition of an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings. Under ASU 2016-16, we recognize the income tax effects of the intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory (e.g., intellectual property or property, plant and equipment) during the period of int ercompany sale or transfer instead of the period of either the sale or transfer to a third party or recognition of depreciation or impairment. New Accounting Standards Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Stan dards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2017-07, \u201cCompensation \u2013 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d (ASU 2017-07), which changes the presentation of periodic bene fit cost components . Under ASU 2017-07, we will continue to present service costs within our operating expenses but present amortization of prior service credits and other components of our net periodic benefit cost in \u201cother income (expense)\u201d in our conso lidated statements of income. ASU 2017-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. See Note 5 for our components of net periodic benefit cost. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASC 606) , and has modified the standard thereafter. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements . ASC 606, as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard using the \u201cmodified retrospective method.\u201d Under that method, we will apply the rules to all contracts exi sting as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous accounting standards.",

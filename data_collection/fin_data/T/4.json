PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one quarter of our period end. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. gen erally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results coul d differ from those estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Income Taxes As of January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-16, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d (ASU 2016-16), with modified retrospective application, resulting in our recognition of an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings. Under ASU 2016-16, we recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory (e.g., intellectual property or property, plant and equipment) during the period of interco mpany sale or transfer instead of the period of either sale or transfer to a third party or recognition of depreciation or impairment. New Accounting Standards Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2017-07, \u201cCompensation \u2013 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d (ASU 2017-07), which changes the presentation of periodic benefit cost components . Under ASU 2017-07, we will continue to present service costs within our operating expenses but present amortization of prior service credits and other components of our net periodic benefit cost in \u201cother income (expense) \u2013 net \u201d in our consoli dated statements of income. ASU 2017-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. See Note 5 for our components of net periodic benefit cost. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue fr om Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASC 606) , and has modified the standard thereafter. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASC 606, as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard using the \u201cmodified retrospective method.\u201d Under that method, we will apply the rules to all open contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous accounting standards .",

SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our segments based on Segment Contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items (as discussed below), and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Business Solutions, (2) Entertainment Group, (3) Consumer Mobility and (4) International. We also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as Segment Contribution excluding equity in ne t income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that managem ent uses to evaluate segment operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divide d by total revenues. The Business Solutions segment provides services to business customers, including multinational companies; governmental and wholesale customers; and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through employer-sponsored plan s. We provide advanced IP-based services including Virtual Private Networks (VPN); Ethernet-related products and broadband, collectively referred to as fixed strategic services; as well as traditional data and voice products. We utilize our wireless and wi red networks to provide a complete communications solution to our business customers. The Entertainment Group segment provides video, internet, voice communication, and interactive and targeted advertising services to customers located in the United Stat es or in U.S. territories. We utilize our copper and IP-based wired network and our satellite technology. The Consumer Mobility segment provides nationwide wireless service to consumers, wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United Stat es or in U.S. territories. We utilize our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet, video and home monitoring services over wireless devices. The International segment provides entertainment services in Latin America and w ireless services in Mexico. Video entertainment services are provided to primarily residential customers using satellite technology. We utilize our regional and national networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and v oice communication services. Our international subsidiaries conduct business in their local currency, and operating results are converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates. In reconciling items to consolidated operating income and income befo re income taxes, Corporate and Other includes: (1) operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, and (2) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the ind ividual segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Certain operating items are not allocated to our business segments, and those include: Acquisition-rela ted items which consists of (1) items associated with the merger and integration of acquired businesses and (2) the noncash amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Certain significant items which consists of (1) noncash actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, (2) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (3) losses resulting from abandonment or impairment of assets and (4) other items for which the segments are not b eing evaluated. I nterest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Our operating assets are utilized by multiple segments and consist of our wireless and wired networks as well as our satellite fleet . Our domestic communications business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that increasingly cut across product lines and utilize our asset base . T herefore , asset information and capital expenditures by segment are not presented. Deprec iation is allocated based on asset utilization by segment.

Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1 974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility II), the primary holding company for our domestic wireless business, to the pension trust used to pay benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a value of $9,354 at September 30, 2017. The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions of $560 per annum, which are distributed quarterly by Mobility II to the trust, in equal amounts and accounted for as contributions. Mobility II distributed $420 to the trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. So long as t hose distributions are made, we will have no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan\u2019s separate financial statements. However, b ecause the preferred equity interest is not unconditionally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation. The preferred equity interest is not transferable by the trust except through its put and call features. In early September 2017, AT&T notified the trust and the fiduciary of the preferred equity interest that AT&T committed that it would not exercise its call option of the preferred interest u ntil at least September 9, 2022, which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the preferred interest of approximately $1,245. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual m easurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. During the second quarter of 2017, a substantive plan change involving the frequency of considering potential health reimbursement account credit increases was communicated to our retirees. This plan change triggered a remeasurement of our postretirement obligations and resulted in additional prior service credits recognized in other comprehensive income, reducing our liability by $1,563. Such credits amortize through earnings over a period approximating the average service period to full eligibility. Upon our adoption of ASU 2017-07, the amortization of these prior service credits will be recorded in other income (expense) \u2013 net. The following table details pension and postretirem ent benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. A portion of these expenses is capitalized as part of internal construction projects, providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded. Service c osts and prior service credits are reported in our segment results while interest costs and expected return on plan assets are included with Corporate and Other (see Note 4).

The discount rate in effect for determining postretirement service and interest costs after remeasurement is 4.50% and 3.30%, respectively. We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans.

                "value": "NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets o r liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in in active markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation method ology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurements level of an asset or liability within the fair value hie rarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodolog ies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2016 . Long-Term Debt and Ot her Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures 1 $ 162,450 $ 171,025 $ 122,381 $ 128,726 Bank borrowings 2 2 4 4 Investment securities 2,565 2,565 2,587 2,587 1 Includes credit agreement borrowings. The carrying amount of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 : September 30, 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,274 $ - $ - $ 1,274 International equities 380 - - 380 Fixed income bonds - 659 - 659 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 45 - 45 Cross-currency swaps - 967 - 967 Liability Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - (34) - (34) Cross-currency swaps - (1,809) - (1,809) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. December 31, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,215 $ - $ - $ 1,215 International equities 594 - - 594 Fixed income bonds - 508 - 508 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 79 - 79 Cross-currency swaps - 89 - 89 Liability Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - (14) - (14) Cross-currency swaps - (3,867) - (3,867) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealize d gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying bas is of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 509 have maturities of less than one year, $ 33 within one to three years, $ 32 within three to five years and $ 85 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments a nd nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative transactions to manage cer tain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivat ives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fa ir value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps witho ut exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as ass ets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 , no ineffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated fro m the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign currency denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts , to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign currency-denominated rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate. Unre alized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash fl ow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income ( expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 , no ineffectiveness was measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a mat erial amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 59 from accumulated OCI to inte rest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction affect s earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based o n respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At September 30, 2017 , we had posted collateral of $837 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $338 (a receipt liability) . Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Ratings, before the final collateral exchange in September , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 141 . If DIRECTV Holdings LLC\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P), we would have been required to post additional collateral of $2 21 . At December 31, 2016 , we had posted collateral of $3,242 (a deposit asset) and held no collateral . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments.

ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Acquisitions Auction 1000 On April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that we were the successful bidder for $910 of spectrum in 18 markets. We provided the FCC an initial deposit of $2,348 in July 2016 and received a refund of $1,438 in April 2017 , which was recorded as cash from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Dispositions YP Holdings LLC In June 2017, YP Holding s LLC was acquir ed by Dex Media. Our results include a gain of $36 for our portion of the proceeds. Pending Acquisitions Time Warner Inc. On October 22, 2016, we entered into and announced a merger agreement (Merger Agreement) to acquire Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner) in a 50% cash and 50% stock transaction for $107.50 per share of Time Warner common stock, or approximately $85,400 at the date of the announcement (Merger). Combined with Time Warner\u2019s net debt at September 30, 2017, the total transaction value is approxi mately $105,834. Each share of Time Warner common stock will be exchanged for $53.75 per share in cash and a number of shares of AT&T common stock equal to the exchange ratio. If the average stock price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at the time of c losing the Merger is between (or equal to) $37.411 and $41.349 per share, the exchange ratio will be the quotient of $53.75 divided by the average stock price. If the average stock price is greater than $41.349, the exchange ratio will be 1.300. If the ave rage stock price is less than $37.411, the exchange ratio will be 1.437. Post-transaction, Time Warner shareholders will own between 14.4% and 15.7% of AT&T shares on a fully-diluted basis based on the number of AT&T shares outstanding. The cash portion of the purchase price will be financed with new debt and cash. Time Warner is a global leader in media and entertainment whose major businesses encompass an array of some of the most respected and successful media brands. The deal combines Time Warner\u2019s vas t library of content and ability to create new premium content for audiences around the world with our extensive customer relationships and distribution, one of the world\u2019s largest pay-TV subscriber bases and leading scale in TV, mobile and broadband distr ibution. The Merger Agreement was approved by Time Warner shareholders on February 15, 2017. The transaction has been approved by all requisite foreign jurisdictions and remains subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice. The transaction is expec ted to close before year-end 2017. If the Merger is terminated as a result of reaching the termination date (and at that time one or more of the conditions relating to certain regulatory approvals have not been satisfied) or there is a final, non-appealabl e order preventing the transaction relating to antitrust laws, communications laws, utilities laws or foreign regulatory laws, then under certain circumstances, we would be obligated to pay Time Warner $500. On October 20, 2017, to facilitate obtaining fin al regulatory approval required to close the merger, AT&T and Time Warner elected to extend the October 22, 2017 termination date of the agreement for a short period of time. Other Events FirstNet On March 30, 2017, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) announced its selection of AT&T to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America\u2019s first responders. FirstNet will provide 20 MHz of valuable telecommunications spectrum and success-based payments of $6,500 over th e next five years to support network buildout. We expect to spend about $40,000, in part recoverable from FirstNet, over the life of the 25-year contract to build, operate and maintain the network. AT&T will construct and operate the network and provide su stainability payments to FirstNet. Sustainability payments are required to be used for the operating expenses of FirstNet and to fund network improvements included in our $40,000 estimate. FirstNet\u2019s operating expenses are anticipated to be in the $75-$100 range annually, and when adjusted for inflation, we expect to be in the $3,000 range over the life of the 25-year contract. After FirstNet\u2019s operating expenses are paid, we anticipate that the remaining amount, expected to be in the $15,000 range, will be rei nvested into the network. As of November 2 , 2017, 30 states and territories have opted-in to the program, representing 3 8 %, or approximately $6, 9 00, of this total sustainability payment commitment. The actual reach of the network and our investment ove r the 25-year period will be determined by the number of individual states and territories electing to participate in FirstNet. States have until December 28, 2017 to elect to opt-out of the federally funded program, after which any state that did not fo rmally make an election will automatically be opted-in. We do not expect FirstNet to materially impact our 2017 results.",

SALES OF EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT RECEIVABLES We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 30 months and, in many cases, they have the right to trade in the original equipment for a new device within a set period and have the remaining unpaid balance satisfied. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, gross equipment installment receivables of $ 4,176 and $5,665 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 2,485 a nd $3,425 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable - net.\u201d In 2014, we entered into an uncommitted agreement pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank and various other relationshi p banks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under this agreement, we transfer certain receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price. Since 2014 , w e have made beneficial modifications to the agreement. During 2017, we modified the agreement and entered into a second uncommitte d agreement with the Purchase rs such that we receive more upfront cash consideration at the time the receivables are transfe rred to the Purchasers . Additionally, in the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract period, we agree to make a payment to the Purchasers equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable balance. Accordingl y, we record a guarantee obligation to the Purchasers for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred. Under the terms of the agreement, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the Purchasers. Sinc e inception, cash proceeds received, net of remittances (excluding amounts returned as deferred purchase price), were $ 4,019 . The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold during the three and nine months ended Septemb er 30, 2017 and 2016: Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Gross receivables sold $ 1,619 $ 1,485 $ 6,217 $ 5,812 Net receivables sold 1 1,478 1,336 5,698 5,263 Cash proceeds received 1,292 891 4,139 3,538 Deferred purchase price recorded 285 463 1,767 1,745 Guarantee obligation recorded 65 - 139 - 1 Receivables net of allowance, imputed interest and trade-in right guarantees. The deferred purchase price and guarantee obligation are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. Th e fair value measurements used for the deferred purchase price and the guarantee obligation are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6). The following table shows the equipment installment receivables, pre viously sold to the Purchasers, which we repurchased in exchange for the associated deferred purchase price during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Fair value of repurchased receivables $ 567 $ 749 $ 1,281 $ 1,281 Carrying value of deferred purchase price 507 722 1,147 1,261 Gain (loss) on repurchases 1 $ 60 $ 27 $ 134 $ 20 1 These gains (losses) are included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our deferred purchase price receivable was $ 3,170 and $3,090, respectively, of which $ 2,023 and $1,606 are included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our d eferred purchase price and guarantee obligation. The sales of equipment installment receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the cash f lows related to the arrangement as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale of the receivables and the collection of the deferred purchase price is not subject to sig nificant interest rate risk.

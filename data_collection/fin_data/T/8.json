            "Preparation Of Interim Financial Statements": {
                "value": "NOTE 1. PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as \u201cAT&T,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany.\u201d These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries an d affiliates, including the results of DIRECTV and wireless properties in Mexico for the period from acquisition to the reporting date. Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications and digital entertainment services industry, providing ser vices and equipment that deliver voice, video and broadband services domestically and internationally. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partners hips where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one quarter of our period end. We also record our propor tionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires ma nagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated statemen ts of cash flows include revisions to present \u201cEquipment installment receivables and related sales\u201d and \u201cDeferred fulfillment costs\u201d separately from \u201cOther \u2013 net\u201d and previously reported changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Flows In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, \u201cStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d (ASU 2016-15), which provides guidance related to cash flows presentation and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, subject to early adoption. The majority of the guidance in ASU 2016-15 is consistent with our current cash flow classifications. However, c ash receipts on the deferred purchase price described in Note 8 will be classified as cash flows from investing activities instead of our current presentation as cash flow from operations. Under ASU 2016-15, we will continue to recognize cash receipts on o wned equipment installment receivables as cash from operations. AT&T\u2019s cash flows from operating activities included cash receipts on the deferred purchase price of $534 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $536 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d (ASU 2016-02), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 w ill require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding \u201cright-of-use\u201d assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, subject to early adoption. For income statement r ecognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or an operating lease without relying upon the bright-line tests under current GAAP. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key change upon adoption will be the balance sheet recognition. The income statement recognition of lease expense appears similar to our current methodology. We are continuing to evaluate other potential impacts to our financial statements. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue f rom Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASU 2014-09) and has modified the standard thereafter. These standards replace existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requireme nts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard. The FASB allows two adoption methods under ASU 2014-09. Under one method, a company will apply th e rules to contracts in all reporting periods presented, subject to certain allowable exceptions. Under the other method, a company will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustme nt for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules (\u201cmodified retrospective method\u201d). We continue to evaluate the available adoption methods. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key chan ges in the standard that impact our revenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues between various services and equipment, and the timing of when those revenues are recognized. We are still in the process of evaluating these impacts. As a result of our accounting policy change for customer set-up and installation costs made in 2015, we believe that the requirement to defer such costs under the new standard will not result in a significant change to our results. However, the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the contract period or expected customer life will result in the recognition of a deferred charge on our balance sheets. We cannot currently estimate the impact of this change upon adopt ion, as the industry continues to undergo changes in how devices and services are sold to customers. Customer Fulfillment Costs During the second quarter of 2016, we updated our analysis of the economic lives of customer relationships, which included a r eview of satellite customer data following the DIRECTV acquisition. As of April 1, 2016, to better reflect the estimated economic lives of satellite and certain business customer relationships, we extended the amortization period to approximately 4.5 years . This change in accounting estimate decreased other cost of services and impacted net income $79, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2016 and $161, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.",

SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our operating segments based on Segment Contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items (as discussed below), and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each operating s egment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Business Solutions, (2) Entertainment Group, (3) Consumer Mobility and (4) International. We also evaluate segment performance based on Segment Contribution, excluding equity in net income (loss) of affiliate s and depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an importa nt metric that management uses to evaluate segment operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA m argin is EBITDA divided by total revenues. The Business Solutions segment provides services to business customers, including multinational companies; governmental and wholesale customers; and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through e mployer-sponsored plans. We provide advanced IP-based services including Virtual Private Networks (VPN); Ethernet-related products and broadband, collectively referred to as strategic business services; as well as traditional data and voice products. We ut ilize our wireless and wired networks (referred to as \u201cwired\u201d or \u201cwireline\u201d) to provide a complete communications solution to our business customers. The Entertainment Group segment provides video, internet, voice communication, and interactive and targe ted advertising services to customers located in the U.S. or in U.S. territories. We utilize our copper and IP-based wired network and/or our satellite technology. The Consumer Mobility segment provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesa le and resale wireless subscribers located in the U.S. or in U.S. territories. We utilize our U.S. wireless network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet, video, and home monitoring services. The International segment provides entertainment services in Latin America and wireless services in Mexico. Video entertainment services are provided to primarily residential customers using satellite technology. We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide co nsumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. Our international subsidiaries conduct business in their local currency, and operating results are converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates. In reconciling items to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, Corporate and Other includes: (1) operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, and (2) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Certain operating items are not allocat ed to our business segments, and those include: Acquisition-related items which consist of (1) operations and support items associated with the merger and integration of acquired businesses and (2) the noncash amortization of intangible assets acquir ed in acquisitions. Certain significant items which consist of (1) noncash actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, (2) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (3) losses resulting fr om abandonment or impairment of assets and (4) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. I nterest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Our operating assets are utilized by multiple segments and consist of our wireless and wired network s as well as an international satellite fleet. We manage our assets to provide for the most efficient, effective and integrated service to our customers, not by operating segment , and, therefore, asset information and capital expenditures by segment are no t presented.

Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1 974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC, the primary holdi ng company for our domestic wireless business, to the trust used to pay pension benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a value of $8,630 at September 30, 2016. The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distribu tions of $560 per annum, which are distributed quarterly in equal amounts and accounted for as contributions. We distributed $420 to the trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. So long as we make the distributions, we will have no limitation s on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan\u2019s separate financial statements. However, because the preferred equity interest is not uncondition ally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation. We also agreed to make a cash contribution to the trust of $175 no later than the due dat es of our federal income tax return for 2015 and 2016. Both such contributions, totaling $350, were made in September 2016. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual measureme nt date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. The following table details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. A portion of these expenses is ca pitalized as part of internal construction projects, providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded. Service costs and prior service credits are reported in our segment results while interest costs and expected return on plan assets are included w ithin Corporate and Other (see Note 4).

We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans.

                "value": "NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets o r liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in in active markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation method ology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurements level of an asset or liability within the fair value hie rarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodolog ies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2015 . Long-Term Debt and Ot her Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures 1 $ 123,962 $ 137,894 $ 124,847 $ 128,993 Bank borrowings 4 4 4 4 Investment securities 2,622 2,622 2,704 2,704 1 Includes credit agreement borrowings. The carrying amount of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 : September 30, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,171 $ - $ - $ 1,171 International equities 571 - - 571 Fixed income bonds - 611 - 611 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 145 - 145 Cross-currency swaps - 151 - 151 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (3,260) - (3,260) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. December 31, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,132 $ - $ - $ 1,132 International equities 569 - - 569 Fixed income bonds - 680 - 680 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 136 - 136 Cross-currency swaps - 556 - 556 Foreign exchange contracts - 3 - 3 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (3,466) - (3,466) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \u201cOther assets,\u201d \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \u201cOther current assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded i n \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying basis of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 87 have maturities of less than one year, $ 277 within one to three years, $ 65 within three to five years and $ 182 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We e nter into derivative transaction s to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange for ward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observab le market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedg ed. Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fi xed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense in the consolidated statements of inc ome. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as assets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offse t by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense . In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 , no i neffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in e xpected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated from the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal fr om fixed foreign currency denominations to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign c urrency-denominated rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are record ed at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earni ngs. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 , no ineffectiveness was measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in inter est payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate lock s are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a material amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 59 from accumulated OCI to interest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into a greements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At September 30, 2016 , we had posted collateral of $2,369 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $8 (a receipt liability) . Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded one rati ng level by Fitch Ratings, before the final collateral exchange in September , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 162 . If DIRECTV Holdings LLC\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P), we wou ld owe an additional $278. At December 31, 2015 , we had posted collateral of $2,343 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $124 (a receipt liability) . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments. Following are the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions: September 30, December 31, 2016 2015 Interest rate swaps $ 7,050 $ 7,050 Cross-currency swaps 29,642 29,642 Foreign exchange contracts - 100 Total $ 36,692 $ 36,792 Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance: Effect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value Hedging Relationships Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Interest rate swaps (Interest expense): Gain (Loss) on interest rate swaps $ (54) $ 54 $ 17 $ 65 Gain (Loss) on long-term debt 54 (54) (17) (65) In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the quarter ended September 30 were offset against interest expense.

ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Acquisitions DIRECTV In July 2015, we completed our acquisition of DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. For accounting purposes, the transaction was valued at $47,409. Our operating results include the results of DIRECTV following the acquisition date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs tha t are not observable in the market and are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition (see Note 6). The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible asset s, consisting of acquired customer relationships, orbital slots and trade names. The income approach estimates fair value for an asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, wa s used primarily for property, plant and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. Goodwill was calculated as the differ ence between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and represents the future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The following table summarizes the fair values of the DIRECTV assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes that existed as of the acquisition date. Assets acquired Cash $ 4,797 Accounts receivable 2,038 All other current assets 1,534 Property, plant and equipment 9,320 Intangible assets not subject to amortization Orbital slots 11,946 Trade name 1,371 Intangible assets subject to amortization Customer lists and relationships 19,508 Trade name 2,915 Other 445 Investments and other assets 2,375 Goodwill 34,619 Total assets acquired 90,868 Liabilities assumed Current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt 5,645 Long-term debt 20,585 Other noncurrent liabilities 16,875 Total liabilities assumed 43,105 Net assets acquired 47,763 Noncontrolling interest (354) Aggregate value of consideration paid $ 47,409 Purchased goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to our Entertainment Group and International segments. Nextel Mexico In April 2015, we completed our acquisition of the subsidiaries of NII Holdings Inc., operating its wireless business in Mexico, for $1,875, including approximately $427 of net debt and other adjustments. The subsidiaries offered service under the name Nextel Mexico. The purchase price allocation of assets acquired was: $376 in licenses, $ 1,167 in property, plant and equipment, $128 in customer lists and $193 of goodwill. The goodwill was allocated to our International segment. GSF Telecom In January 2015, we acquired Mexican wireless company GSF Telecom Holdings, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (GSF Te lecom) for $2,500, including net debt of approximately $700. GSF Telecom offered service under both the Iusacell and Unefon brand names in Mexico. The purchase price allocation of assets acquired was: $735 in licenses, $658 in property, plant and equipm ent, $378 in customer lists, $26 in trade names and $956 of goodwill. The goodwill was allocated to our International segment. AWS-3 Auction In January 2015, we submitted winning bids of $18,189 in the Advanced Wireless Service (AWS)-3 Auction (FCC Aucti on 97) , a portion of which represented spectrum clearing and First Responder Network Authority funding . We provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) an initial down payment of $921 in October 2014 and paid the remaining $17,268 in the first quar ter of 2015. ",

SALES OF EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT RECEIVABLES We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 30 months and, in many cases, they have the right to trade in the original equipment for a new device within a set period and have the remaining unpaid balance satisfied. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, gross equipment installment receivables of $5,015 and $5,719 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $3,053 a nd $3,239 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable - net.\u201d In 2014, we entered into an uncommitted agreement pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank and various other relationsh ip banks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under this agreement, we transferred the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price. Under the te rms of the agreement, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the Purchasers.

The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used are considered Leve l 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6).

                "value": "NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT Pending Acquisition On October 22, 2016, we announced a merger agreement (Merger Agreement) to acquire Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner) in a 50% cash and 50% stock transaction for $107.50 per share of Time Warner common stock, or approximately $85,400 at the date of the announcement (Merger). Combined with Time Warner\u2019s net debt at September 30, 2016, the total transaction value is approximately $108,700. Each share of Time Warner common stock will be exchanged for $53.75 per share in cash and a number of shares (exchange ratio) of AT&T common stock based on the average stock price at the time of closing the Merger. If the average stock price is between (or equal to) $37.411 and $41.349 per share, the exchange ratio will be the quot ient of $53.75 divided by the average stock price. If the average stock price is greater than $41.349, the exchange ratio will be 1.300. If the average stock price is less than $37.411, the exchange ratio will be 1.437. Post-transaction, Time Warner shareh olders will own between 14.4% and 15.7% of AT&T shares on a fully-diluted basis based on the number of AT&T shares outstanding. The cash portion of the purchase price will be financed with new debt and cash. As further discussed below, we have an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge term facility (Bridge Loan) for $40,000. Time Warner is a leading media and entertainment company whose major businesses encompass an array of the most respected and successful media brands. The deal combines Time Warner \u2019s vast library of content and ability to create new premium content that connects with audiences around the world, with our extensive customer relationships, world\u2019s largest pay TV subscriber base and leading scale in TV, mobile and broadband distribution . The Merger Agreement must be adopted by Time Warner shareholders and is subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and if certain FCC licenses remain with Time Warner at closing, those are subject to FCC review and approval. It is also a condit ion to closing that necessary consents from certain public utility commissions and foreign governmental entities must be obtained. The transaction is expected to close before year end 2017. If the Merger is terminated as a result of reaching the terminatio n date (and at that time one or more of the conditions relating to certain regulatory approvals have not been satisfied) or there is a final, non-appealable order preventing the transaction relating to antitrust laws, communications laws, utilities laws or foreign regulatory laws, then under certain circumstances we would be obligated to pay Time Warner $500. Bridge Loan On October 22, 2016, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, AT&T entered into the Bridge Loan with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N .A., as agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A., as lenders. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan, those advances would be used solely to finance a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Merger, the refi nancing of debt of T ime Warner and its subsidiaries and the payment of related fees and expenses. We have not drawn on this facility. The obligations of the lenders under the Bridge Loan to provide advances will terminate on the earliest of (i) the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement without the borrowing of advances under the Bridge Loan and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nAdvances wou ld bear interest, at the Company\u2019s option, either: \u2022 at a variable annual rate equal to: (1) the highest of (a) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (b) 0.5% per annum above the federal funds rate, and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate applicable to dollars for a period of one month plus 1.00%, plus (2) an applicable margin, as set forth in the Bridge Loan (the \u201cApplicable Margin for Base Advances\u201d); or \u2022 at a rate equal to: (i) LIBOR (adjusted upwards to reflect any bank reserve c osts) for a period of one, two, three or six months, as applicable, plus (ii) an applicable margin, as set forth in the Bridge Loan (the \u201cApplicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances\u201d). The Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances will be equal to 0.750%, 1.000%, 1.125%, 1.250% or 1.500% per annum depending on the Company\u2019s unsecured long-term debt ratings. The Applicable Margin for Base Advances will be equal to the greater of (x) 0.00% and (y) the relevant Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Ad vances minus 1.00% per annum, depending on the Company\u2019s unsecured long-term debt ratings. The Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances and the Applicable Margin for Base Advances are scheduled to increase by an additional 0.25% on the 90th day after the closing of the Merger and another 0.25% every 90 days thereafter. The Company will also pay a commitment fee (Commitment Fee) of 0.070%, 0.090%, 0.100%, 0.125% or 0.175% of the commitment amount per annum, depending on the Company\u2019s unsecured lo ng-term debt ratings. The Company is scheduled to pay a duration fee of 0.50%, 0.75% and 1.00% on the amount of advances outstanding as of the 90th, 180th and 270th day after advances are made. The Bridge Loan contains provisions requiring the reduction of the commitments of the lenders and the prepayment of outstanding advances by the amount of net cash proceeds resulting from the incurrence of certain indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries, the issuance of certain capital stock by the Company o r its subsidiaries and non-ordinary course sales or dispositions of assets by the Company or its subsidiaries, in each case subject to exceptions set forth in the Bridge Loan. Advances under the Bridge Loan are conditioned on the absence of a material adv erse effect on Time Warner and certain customary events, and repayment of all advances must be made no later than 364 days after the date on which the advances are made. The Bridge Loan contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investmen t grade senior debt credit rating, as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other modifications described in the Bridge Loan) financial ratio covenant that the Company will maintain, as of the las t day of each fiscal quarter of not more than 3.5-to-1. The events of default contained in the Bridge Loan are customary for an agreement of this type and such events would result in the acceleration of, or would permit the lenders to accelerate, as appli cable, required payments and would increase the Applicable Margin by 2.00% per annum. Prior to the closing date of the Merger, only a payment or bankruptcy event of default would permit the lenders to terminate their commitments under the Bridge Loan.",

The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries an d affiliates, including the results of DIRECTV and wireless properties in Mexico for the period from acquisition to the reporting date. Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications and digital entertainment services industry, providing ser vices and equipment that deliver voice, video and broadband services domestically and internationally. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partners hips where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one quarter of our period end. We also record our propor tionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires ma nagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated statemen ts of cash flows include revisions to present \u201cEquipment installment receivables and related sales\u201d and \u201cDeferred fulfillment costs\u201d separately from \u201cOther \u2013 net\u201d and previously reported changes in operating assets and liabilities.",

The majority of the guidance in ASU 2016-15 is consistent with our current cash flow classifications. However, c ash receipts on the deferred purchase price described in Note 8 will be classified as cash flows from investing activities instead of our current presentation as cash flow from operations. Under ASU 2016-15, we will continue to recognize cash receipts on o wned equipment installment receivables as cash from operations. AT&T\u2019s cash flows from operating activities included cash receipts on the deferred purchase price of $ 534 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $ 536 for the year ended December 31, 2015.",

For income statement r ecognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or an operating lease without relying upon the bright-line tests under current GAAP.

These standards replace existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requireme nts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard. The FASB allows two adoption methods under ASU 2014-09. Under one method, a company will apply th e rules to contracts in all reporting periods presented, subject to certain allowable exceptions. Under the other method, a company will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustme nt for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules (\u201cmodified retrospective method\u201d). We continue to evaluate the available adoption methods. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key chan ges in the standard that impact our revenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues between various services and equipment, and the timing of when those revenues are recognized. We are still in the process of evaluating these impacts. As a result of our accounting policy change for customer set-up and installation costs made in 2015, we believe that the requirement to defer such costs under the new standard will not result in a significant change to our results. However, the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the contract period or expected customer life will result in the recognition of a deferred charge on our balance sheets. We cannot currently estimate the impact of this change upon adopt ion, as the industry continues to undergo changes in how devices and services are sold to customers.",

PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as \u201cAT&T,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany.\u201d We believe that these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals, that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications services industry both domestically and internationally, providing wireless communications services, traditional wireline voice services, data/broadband and Internet services, video services, telecommunications equipment, managed networking and wholesale services. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one month of our period end. We also recorded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including actuarial gains and losses on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. New Accounting Standards Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASU 2014-09), which replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for annual reporting periods b eginning after December 15, 2017, following the July 2015 approval of a one-year deferral of the effective date by the FASB . We continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods. Long-Term Debt and Debt Issuance Costs In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cInterest\u2014Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d (ASU 2015-03), which will result in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from \u201cOther Assets\u201d to inclusion as a red uction of our reportable \u201cLong-T erm Debt\u201d balance on our consolidated balance sheets. ASU 2015-03 becomes effective January 1, 2016, subject to early adoption, and will require full retrospective application. We do not expect this new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. ",

We analyze our operating segments based on segment income before income taxes.

Actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, interest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, these items are not included in each segment's reportable results. The customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the United States. We have three reportable segments: (1) Wireless, (2) Wireline and (3) International. The Wireless segment uses our nationwide network to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communications services. The Wireline segment uses our regional, national and global network to provide consumer and business customers with data and voice communications services, AT&T U-verse \u00ae high speed Internet, video and VoIP services and managed networking to business customers. The International segment uses the Iusacell , Unefon , and Nextel Mexico regional and national networks to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services in Mexico. Results from the equity method investment in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil S.A. de C.V. (prior to the June 2014 disposal of our investment) are included in this segment. The Corporate and Other column includes unallocated corporate expenses, which includes costs to support corporate-driven activities and operations, and impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as our actuarial gains and losses on our pension and postretirement plan valuations. Results from equity method investments in YP Holdings LLC and Otter Media (our joint venture with The Chernin Group), are also excluded from our segment results as those results are not considered in our assessment of segment performance.

                "value": "NOTE 5 . PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Substantially all of our employees are covered by one of our noncontributory pension plans. We also provide certain medical, dental, life insurance, and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In December 2014, we offered an opportunity for certain management employees who were retirement eligible as of March 31, 2015 to elect an enhanced, full lump sum payment option of their accrued pension if they retired on or before March 31, 2015. The lump sum value totaled approximately $1,200 which will be distributed in 2015. We recorded special termination benefits of approximately $150 as a result of this offer. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC, the primary holding company for our domestic wireless business, to the trust used to pay pension benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a value of $ 8,896 at June 30, 2015. The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions of $560 per annum, which are distributed quarterly in equal amounts and accounted for as contributions. We distributed $280 to the trust during the six months ended June 30, 2015. So long as we make the distributions, we will have no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan's separate financial statements. However, because the preferred equity interest is not unconditionally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation. We also agreed to make a cash contribution to the trust of $175 no later than the due date of our federal income tax return for 2014. This contribution was made in June 2015. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. The following table details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, expense credits are denoted with parentheses. A portion of these expenses is capitalized as part of internal construction projects, providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded.

The decrease is primarily due to the change in the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. While this change in estimate , which was made in the fourth quarter of 2014, provides a more precise measurement of interim service and interest costs, it will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as of December 31 or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the change in the service and interest costs is completely offset in the actuarial gain or loss reported. The decrease from this change was partially offset by lower amortization of prior service credits as previous postretirement plan changes have become fully amortized, our lower expected long-term rate of return on our postretirement plan assets an d updated assumed mortality rates. We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans. Net supplemental retirement pension benefits cost, which is not included in the table above, was $ 21 in the second quarter of 2015 , of which $ 18 was interest cost, and $ 41 for the first six months , of which $ 37 was interest cost. In 2014 , net supplemental retirement pension benefits cost was $ 29 in the second quarter, of which $ 28 was interest cost, and $ 58 for the first six months , of which $ 55 was interest cost. ",

                "value": "NOTE 6 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurement s level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2014 . Long-Term Debt and Other Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures $ 113,167 $ 116,669 $ 81,632 $ 90,367 Bank borrowings 5 5 5 5 Investment securities 2,758 2,758 2,735 2,735 The carrying value of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 : June 30, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,165 $ - $ - $ 1,165 International equities 614 - - 614 Fixed income bonds - 778 - 778 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 170 - 170 Cross-currency swaps - 1,280 - 1,280 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (2,568) - (2,568) December 31, 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,160 $ - $ - $ 1,160 International equities 553 - - 553 Fixed income bonds - 836 - 836 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 157 - 157 Cross-currency swaps - 1,243 - 1,243 Interest rate locks - 5 - 5 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (1,506) - (1,506) Interest rate locks - (133) - (133) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \"Other assets,\" \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying basis of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 93 have maturities of less than one year, $ 392 within one to three years, $ 63 within three to five years, and $ 230 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments ( certificate and time deposits ) and customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investment s are recorded in \u201cOther current a ssets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We employ derivatives to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. The majority of our derivatives are designated either as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as assets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense . In the six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated from the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling , Canadian dollar and Swiss Franc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominations to fixed U.S. denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate, which was determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign-denominated rate to a fixed U.S. denominated interest rate. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities, both for the period they are outstanding. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a material amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 61 from accumulated OCI to interest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Some of these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges while others remain nondesignated . Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cO ther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. In the six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements . At June 30, 2015 , we had posted collateral of $1,544 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $396 (a receipt liability) . Under the agreements, if our credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Rating s , before the final collateral exchange in June , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 69 . At December 31, 2014 , we had posted collateral of $530 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $599 (a receipt liability) . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), against the fair value of the derivative instruments . Following is the notional amount of our outstanding derivative positions: June 30, December 31, 2015 2014 Interest rate swaps $ 8,050 $ 6,550 Cross-currency swaps 27,375 26,505 Interest rate locks - 6,750 Total $ 35,425 $ 39,805 Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance: Effect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value Hedging Relationships Three months ended Six months ended June 30, 2015 June 30, 2014 June 30, 2015 June 30, 2014 Interest rate swaps (Interest expense): Gain (Loss) on interest rate swaps $ (30) $ 22 $ 11 $ 11 Gain (Loss) on long-term debt 30 (22) (11) (11) In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the quarter ended June 30 were included in interest expense.

ACQUISITIONS , DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Acquisitions Nextel Mexico On April 30, 2015, we completed our acquisition of the subsidiaries of NII Holdings Inc., operating its wireless business in Mexico, for $ 1,875, less approximately $427 of net debt and other adjustments. The subsidiaries offer service under the name Nextel Mexico. The preliminary values of assets acquired were: $ 338 in licenses, $ 1,2 06 in property, plant and equipment, $ 157 in customer lists and $ 363 of goodwill. GSF Telecom On January 16, 2015, we acquired Mexican wireless company GSF Telecom Holdings, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (GSF Telecom) for $ 2,500, less net debt of approximately $700 . GSF Telecom offers service under both the Iusacell and Unefon brand names in Mexico. The preliminary values of assets acquired were: $ 865 in licenses, $ 9 52 in property, plant and equipment, $ 308 in customer lists, $ 26 in trade names and $ 919 of goodwill. AWS-3 Auction In January 2015, we submitted winning bids for 251 Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) spectrum licenses in the AWS-3 Auction (FCC Auction 97) for $18,189. We provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) an initial down payment of $921 in October 2014 and paid the remaining $17,268 in the first quarter of 2015. The interest associated with this acquisition will be excluded from interest expense and capitalized until this spectrum is ready for its intended use. Subsequent Acquisition DIRECTV On July 24 , 2015, we completed our acquisition of DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. The acquisition represents an opportunity for us to acquire a unique and complementary set of assets and achieve substantial cost synergies over time, as well as increasing revenue from pay television in Latin America . Our distribution scale will enable us to offer consumers bundles including video, high-speed broadband and mobile services, using all the sales channels of both companies. We believe the combined company will be a content distribution leader across mobile, video and broadband platforms. Under the merger agreement, each share of DIRECTV stock was exchanged for $28.50 cash plus 1. 892 shares of our common stock. We issued a final total of 954,5 18 , 588 shares to DIRECTV shareholde rs, giving them an approximate 16 % stake in the combined company, based on common shares outstanding. Based on our $ 34.29 per share closing stock price on July 24 , 2015, total consideration paid to DIRECTV shareholders was $ 47 , 110 , including $ 32 , 731 of AT&T stock and $ 14 , 379 in cash. DIRECTV had approximately $ 1 5 , 891 in net debt at acquisition . Our third-quarter 2015 operating results will include the results from DIRECTV following the date of acquisition. Our consolidated balance sheet will include the assets and liabilities of DIRECTV, which are being appraised by a third-party and include various assumptions in determining fair value. Issues that are more unique in this acquisition include the valuation of satellite orbital slots and foreign exchange rates in valuing foreign operations, including those in Venezuela. With this acquisition, we also expect to change our accounting for custome r set-up and installation costs, having already discussed this change with the Sec urities and Exchange Commission. AT&T's historical results will be revised to reflect the retrospective application of this accounting change . We are also considering the implications of our new management structure and organizational responsibilities on our operating segments .",

SALES OF EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT RECEIVABLES We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 30 months, with the right to trade in the original equipment for a new device within a set period and have the remaining unpaid balance satisfied. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, gross equipment installment receivables of $ 3,92 9 and $4,265 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 2,348 and $2,514 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable, net.\u201d On June 27, 2014, we entered into the first of a series of uncommitted agreements pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank, N.A. and various other relationship banks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under these agreements, we transferred the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables. Under the terms of the arrangements, we continue to bill and collect on behalf of our customers for the receivables sold. To date, we have collected and remitted approximately $ 2,263 (net of fees), of which $ 254 was returned as deferred purchase price. The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold during the three months and six months ended June 30 , 2015 and 2014 : Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Gross receivables sold $ 1,728 $ 1,637 $ 4,363 $ 1,637 Net receivables sold 1 1,555 1,391 3,936 1,391 Cash proceeds received 1,049 819 2,573 819 Deferred purchase price recorded 505 565 1,363 565 1 Receivables net of allowance, imputed interest and trade-in right guarantees. The deferred purchase price was initially recorded at estimated fair value, which was based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected, adjusted by the expected timing and value of device trade-ins, and is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6). At June 30, 2015, our deferred purchase price receivable was $2,857, of which $1,677 is included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d At December 31, 2014, our deferred purchase price receivable was $1,606, which is included in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the amount of our deferred purchase price at any point in time. The sales of equipment installment receivables did not have a material impact in our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the cash flows related to the arrangement as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale of the receivables and the collection of the deferred purchase price is not subject to significant interest rate risk.",

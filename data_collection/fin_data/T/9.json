                "value": "NOTE 1 . PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as \u201cAT&T,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany.\u201d T hese consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods , consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items . The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates , including the results of DIRECTV for the 68-day period ended September 30, 2015 . Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications and digital entertainment services industry , providing services and equ ipment that deliver voice, video and broadband services domestically and internationally . All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one month of our period end. We also recorded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including actuarial gains and losses on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and cumulative translation adjustments . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation , including our presentation of \u201cEquipment\u201d and \u201cBroadcast, programming and operations\u201d expenses separately f rom other cost of services in the consolidated statements of income. Due to recent organizational changes and our July 24, 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we are revising our operating segments to align with the new management structure and or ganizational responsibilities. We have revised our prior-period presentation to conform to our current reporting . (S ee Note 4) Customer Fulfillment Costs In August 2015, with our acquisition of DIRECTV, we announced a change in accounting for customer set-up and installation costs. Historically we have followed an accounting polic y of deferring customer set-up and installation costs only to the extent of deferred revenues recorded for upfront fees (e.g., activation charges), and to expense any costs that exce ed deferred revenues. After discussing this change with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we changed our accounting to a preferable method of capitalizing these costs and amortizing them over the expected economic life of the customer relationship of approximately four years, subject to an assessment of the recoverability of such costs. This change in accounting principle impacts video, broadband Internet and wireline voice services and is considered prefe rable in that it provides an accurate reflection of assets (i.e., the contractual customer relationship obtained through the set-up and installation) generated by those specific business activities. Our new accounting method is more comparable with the accounting method used in the cable entertainment industry. With our acquisition of DIRECTV, changing to this accounting method will enhance comparability to other companies in the industry . This change in accounting does not have an impact on our wireless results , due to the absence of these types of expenses in those business activities . The cumulative effect of the change on Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2014, was an increase of approximately $ 3,128 on our consolidated balance sheets. This change did not have an impact on cash provided by or used in operations for any period presented. The following tables present our results under our historical method and as adjusted to reflect the accounting change: Historical Accounting Method As\nAdjusted Effect of Change For the three months ended September 30, 2015 Other cost of services $ 9,290 $ 9,214 $ (76) Income tax expense 1,628 1,657 29 Net Income 3,031 3,078 47 Net Income Attributable to AT&T 2,947 2,994 47 Basic Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 0.50 $ 0.50 $ - Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T 0.50 0.50 - At September 30, 2015 or for the nine months ended Other cost of services $ 27,842 $ 27,604 $ (238) Income tax expense 4,694 4,784 90 Net Income 9,453 9,601 148 Net Income Attributable to AT&T 9,191 9,339 148 Basic Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 1.68 $ 1.71 $ 0.03 Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T 1.68 1.71 0.03 Other current assets $ 9,579 $ 11,254 $ 1,675 Other Assets 10,671 13,585 2,914 Deferred income taxes 51,949 53,044 1,095 Retained earnings 29,133 32,627 3,494 Historical Accounting Method As\nAdjusted Effect of Change For the three months ended September 30, 2014 Other cost of services $ 9,071 $ 8,866 $ (205) Income tax expense 1,367 1,444 77 Net Income 3,059 3,187 128 Net Income Attributable to AT&T 3,002 3,130 128 Basic Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 0.58 $ 0.60 $ 0.02 Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T 0.58 0.60 0.02 For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 Other cost of services $ 26,552 $ 26,167 $ (385) Income tax expense 5,769 5,914 145 Net Income 10,414 10,654 240 Net Income Attributable to AT&T 10,201 10,441 240 Basic Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 1.96 $ 2.00 $ 0.04 Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to AT&T 1.95 2.00 0.05 Historical Accounting Method As\nAdjusted Effect of Change At December 31, 2014 Other current assets $ 8,067 $ 9,802 $ 1,735 Other Assets 10,998 13,659 2,661 Accrued taxes 1,091 1,136 45 Deferred income taxes 37,544 38,549 1,005 Retained earnings 27,736 31,081 3,345 New Accounting Standards Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASU 2014-09), which replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for annual reporting periods b eginning after December 15, 2017, following the July 2015 approval of a one-year deferral of the effective date by the FASB . W hile w e continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard on revenue and costs of acquisition as well as available adoption methods , the requirement to defer costs is not expected to have a significant impact on our operating results as a result of our policy change on fulfillment costs . Long-Term Debt and Debt Issuance Costs In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cInterest\u2014Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d (ASU 2015-03), which will result in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from \u201cOther Assets\u201d to inclusion as a red uction of our reportable \u201cLong-T erm Debt\u201d balance on o ur consolidated balance sheets. Since ASU 2015-03 does not address deferred issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, \u201c Interest\u2014Imputation of Interest : Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arr angem ents\u201d (ASU 2015-15), in August 2015. ASU 2015-15 allow s a company to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements , including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings , classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements . ASU 2015-03 become s effective January 1, 2016, subject to early adoption, and will require full retrospective ap plication. We do not expect these new standard s to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. Business Combinations In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-16, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u2014Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d (ASU 2015-16), which will result in the ability to recognize , in current-period earnings, any changes in provisional amounts during the measurement period after the closing of an acquisition , instead of retroactively account ing for these changes . ASU 2015-16 becomes effective January 1, 2016, subject to early adoption, and will require prospective application to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU 2015-16. We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our operating results . ",

SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. Due to recent organizational changes and our July 24, 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we are revising our oper ating segments to align with our new management structure and organizational responsibilities. We analyze our operating segments based on segment contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition - related costs and other significant items (as discussed below) , and equity in net income of affiliates for investments managed within each operating segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Business Solutions, (2) Entertainment and Internet Services, (3) Consumer Mobility and (4) International. We have revised our prior-period presentation to conform to our current reporting. We also evaluate segment performance based on segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. For AT&T, EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate segment operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. The Business Solutions segment provides both wireless and wireline services to business customers and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through employer-sponsored plans.

The exchange rate used to report net monetary assets and operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the Sistema Marginal de Divisas (SIMADI), which was 199.65 and 199.42 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar at July 24, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Our International segment is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In reconciling items to consolidated operating income, Corporate and Other include s : (1) operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, and (2) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Certain operating items are not allocated to our business segments: Acquisition-related items include (1) operations and support items associated with the merger and integration of newly acquired businesses, and (2) the noncash amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Certain significant items include (1) noncash actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, (2) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers , (3) abandonment or impairments of assets and (4) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. I nterest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, these items are also not included in each segment's reportable results. Our operating assets are shared by multiple segments and consist of our wireless and wired networks as well as a n international satellite fleet . We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, and therefore asset information and capital expenditures by operating segment are not presented.

                "value": "NOTE 5 . PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Substantially all of our employees are covered by one of our noncontributory pension plans. We also provide certain medical, dental, life insurance, and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In December 2014, we offered an opportunity for certain management employees who were retirement eligible as of March 31, 2015 to elect an enhanced, full lump sum payment option of their accrued pension if they retired on or before March 31, 2015. The lump sum value totaled approximately $1,200 which was distributed in 2015. We recorded special termination benefits of approximately $150 as a result of this offer. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC, the primary holding company for our domestic wireless business, to the trust used to pay pension benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a value of $ 8,838 at September 30, 2015. The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions of $560 per annum, which are distributed quarterly in equal amounts and accounted for as contributions. We distributed $ 420 to the trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. So long as we make the distributions, we will have no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan's separate financial statements. However, because the preferred equity interest is not unconditionally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation. We also agreed to make a cash contribution to the trust of $175 no later than the due date of our federal income tax return for 2014. This contribution was made in June 2015. We acquired DIRECTV on July 24, 2015. DIRECTV sponsor s a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which provides benefits to most employees based on either years of service and final average salary, or eligible compensation while employed by DIRECTV. DIRECTV also maintain s (1) a postretirement benefit plan for those retirees eligible to participate in health care and life insurance benefits generally until they reach age 65 and (2) an unfunded nonqualified pension plan for certain eligible employees. We have recorded the fair value of the DIRECTV plans using assumptions and accounting policies consistent with those disclosed by AT&T. Upon acquisition, the excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets was recognized as a liability and previously existing deferred actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized service costs or benefits were eliminated. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. The following table details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income ; expense credits are denoted with parentheses. A portion of these expenses is capitalized as part of internal construction projects, providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded.

Our combined net pension and postretirement cost decreased $223 in the third quarter and $669 for the first nine months due to the change in the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. While this change, which was made in the fourth quarter of 2014, provides a more precise measurement of interim service and interest costs, it will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as of December 31 or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the change in the service and interest costs is completely offset in the actuarial gain or loss reported. The decrease in cost resulting from this change was partially offset by lower amortization of prior service credits as previous postretirement plan changes have become fully amortized, our lower expected long-term rate of return on our postretirement plan assets and updated assumed mortality rates. We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans. Net supplemental retirement pension benefits cost, which is not included in the table above, was $ 22 in the third quarter of 2015 , of which $ 20 was interest cost, and $ 63 for the first nine months , of which $ 57 was interest cost. In 2014 , net supplemental retirement pension benefits cost was $ 29 in the third quarter, of which $ 27 was interest cost, and $ 87 for the first nine months , of which $ 82 was interest cost.",

                "value": "NOTE 6 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurement s level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2014 . Long-Term Debt and Other Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures $ 126,042 $ 129,524 $ 81,632 $ 90,367 Bank borrowings 4 4 5 5 Investment securities 2,644 2,644 2,735 2,735 The carrying value of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 : September 30, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,094 $ - $ - $ 1,094 International equities 561 - - 561 Fixed income bonds - 737 - 737 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 217 - 217 Cross-currency swaps - 796 - 796 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (3,202) - (3,202) Foreign exchange contracts - (1) - (1) December 31, 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,160 $ - $ - $ 1,160 International equities 553 - - 553 Fixed income bonds - 836 - 836 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 157 - 157 Cross-currency swaps - 1,243 - 1,243 Interest rate locks - 5 - 5 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (1,506) - (1,506) Interest rate locks - (133) - (133) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \"Other assets,\" \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying basis of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 93 have maturities of less than one year, $ 379 within one to three years, $ 52 within three to five years, and $ 213 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments ( certificate and time deposits ) and customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investment s are recorded in \u201cOther current a ssets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We employ derivatives to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. The majority of our derivatives are designated either as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as assets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt. Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense . In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated from the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling , Canadian dollar and Swiss Franc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominations to fixed U.S. denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate, usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign-denominated rate to a fixed U.S. denominated interest rate. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities, both for the period they are outstanding. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a material amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 59 from accumulated OCI to interest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Some of these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges while others remain nondesignated . Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cO ther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements . At September 30, 2015 , we had posted collateral of $1,807 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $379 (a receipt liability) . Under the agreements, if our credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Rating s , before the final collateral exchange in September , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 105 . If D IREC TV Holdings LLC 's credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P) and below Baa3 (Moody's) we would owe an additional $92 . At December 31, 2014 , we had posted collateral of $530 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $599 (a receipt liability) . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), against the fair value of the derivative instruments . Following is the notional amount of our outstanding derivative positions: September 30, December 31, 2015 2014 Interest rate swaps $ 7,050 $ 6,550 Cross-currency swaps 29,642 26,505 Interest rate locks - 6,750 Foreign exchange contracts 23 - Total $ 36,715 $ 39,805 Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance: Effect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value Hedging Relationships Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2015 September 30, 2014 September 30, 2015 September 30, 2014 Interest rate swaps (Interest expense): Gain (Loss) on interest rate swaps $ 54 $ (70) $ 65 $ (59) Gain (Loss) on long-term debt (54) 70 (65) 59 In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the quarter ended September 30 were included in interest expense.

                "value": "NOTE 7. ACQUISITIONS , DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Acquisitions DIRECTV On July 24 , 2015, we completed our acquisition of DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. The acquisition represents an opportunity for us to integrate a unique and complementary set of assets and achieve substantial cost synergies over time, as well as generate revenue from pay television in Latin America . Our distribution scale will enable us to offer consumers bundles including video, high-speed broadband and mobile services, using all the sales channels of both companies. We believe the combined company will be a content distribution leader across mobile, video and broadband platforms. Under the merger agreement, each share of DIRECTV stock was exchanged for $28.50 cash plus 1. 892 shares of our common stock. After adjustment for shares issued to trust s consolidated by AT&T, share- based payment arrangements and fractional shares, which were settled in cash, AT&T issued 954, 407,524 shares to DIRECTV shareholde rs, giving them an approximate 16 % stake in the combined company, based on common shares outstanding. Based on our $ 34.29 per share closing stock price on July 24 , 2015, the aggregate value of consideration paid to DIRECTV shareholders was $ 47 , 40 4 , including $ 32 , 7 27 of AT&T stock and $ 14 , 37 8 in cash and $29 9 for share - based payment arrangements . Our third-quarter 2015 operating results include the results from DIRECTV following the acquisition date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships. The income approach estimates fair value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for plant, property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation . Our September 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet include s the assets and liabilities of DIRECTV, which have be en measured at f air value. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the DIRECTV assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes as of the acquisition date. DIRECTV Assets acquired Cash $ 4,763 Accounts receivable 2,116 All other current assets 1,795 Property, plant and equipment (including satellites) 8,811 Intangible assets not subject to amortization Orbital slots 11,946 Trade name (Latin America) 1,371 Intangible assets subject to amortization Customer lists and relationships 19,803 Trade name (U.S.) 1,634 Other 324 Investments and other assets 3,730 Goodwill 35,343 Total assets acquired 91,636 Liabilities assumed Current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt 5,886 Long-term debt 20,500 Other noncurrent liabilities 17,492 Total liabilities assumed 43,878 Net assets acquired 47,758 Noncontrolling interest (354) Aggregate value of consideration paid $ 47,404 The se estimates are preliminary in nature and subject to adjustments , which could be material . Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. Substantially all the receivables acquired are expected to be collectible. We have not identified any material unrecorded pre-acquisition contingencies where the related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and represents the future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of acquisition. Prior to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, if information becomes available that would indicate it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the final purchase price allocation and may change goodwill. Purchased goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. As we finalize the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we will determine to which business segments and reporting units th at any changes in goodwill should be recorded. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations assume that the acquisition of DIRECTV was completed as of January 1 for each of the fiscal years shown below: Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Total operating revenues 1 $ 41,230 $ 41,301 $ 123,346 $ 122,263 Net Income Attributable to AT&T 2,985 3,429 9,210 11,065 Basic Earnings Per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 0.50 $ 0.56 $ 1.69 $ 1.80 Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to AT&T $ 0.50 $ 0.55 $ 1.69 $ 1.79 1 Reflects revenue declines resulting from our fourth-quarter 2014 sale of our Connecticut wireline operations. Nonrecurring adjustments included in the pro forma results above consist of the following: At June 30, 2015, due to the continued economic uncertainty and lack of liquidity in all three of the official currency exchange mechanisms in Venezuela, DIRECTV changed the exchange rate used to measure its Venezuelan subsidiary's monetary assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars from Sistema Complementario de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas (SICAD) to SIMADI. The significant change in exchange rates also required the reevaluation of the recoverability of fixed and intangible assets and inventory, which result ed in an impairment charge of $1,060 recorded in DIRECTV's c onsolidated s tatement of o perations. Prior to DIRECTV's June 30, 2015 change to the SIMADI, operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were me a sured using the SICAD exchange rate which resulted in revenues in Venezuela of approximately $500 and operating profit before depreciation and amortization of approximately $180. Pro forma data may not be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had these events occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it intended to be a projection of future results. Nextel Mexico On April 30, 2015, we completed our acquisition of the subsidiaries of NII Holdings Inc., operating its wireless business in Mexico, for $ 1,875, including approximately $427 of net debt and other adjustments. The subsidiaries offer service under the name Nextel Mexico. The preliminary values of assets acquired were: $ 3 76 in licenses, $1, 391 in property, plant and equipment, $ 65 in customer lists and $ 414 of goodwill. GSF Telecom On January 16, 2015, we acquired Mexican wireless company GSF Telecom Holdings, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (GSF Telecom) for $ 2,500, including net debt of approximately $700 . GSF Telecom offers service under both the Iusacell and Unefon brand names in Mexico. The preliminary values of assets acquired were: $920 in licenses, $712 in property, plant and equipment, $311 in customer lists, $26 in trade names and $1,124 of goodwill. AWS-3 Auction In January 2015, we submitted winning bids for 251 Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) spectrum licenses in the AWS-3 Auction (FCC Auction 97) for $18,189. We provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) an initial down payment of $921 in October 2014 and paid the remaining $17,268 in the first quarter of 2015. The interest associated with this acquisition will be excluded from interest expense and capitalized until this spectrum is ready for its intended use. ",

SALES OF EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT RECEIVABLES We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 30 months, with the right to trade in the original equipment for a new device within a set period and have the remaining unpaid balance satisfied. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, gross equipment installment receivables of $ 4,428 and $4,265 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 2,690 and $2,514 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable, net.\u201d On June 27, 2014, we entered into the first of a series of uncommitted agreements pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank, N.A. and various other relationship banks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under these agreements, we transferred the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables. Under the terms of the arrangements, we continue to bill and collect on behalf of our customers for the receivables sold. To date, we have collected and remitted approximately $ 3,394 (net of fees), of which $ 421 was returned as deferred purchase price. The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold during the three months and nine months ended September 30 , 2015 and 2014 : Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Gross receivables sold $ 1,601 $ 1,028 $ 5,964 $ 2,665 Net receivables sold 1 1,431 885 5,367 2,276 Cash proceeds received 980 556 3,553 1,375 Deferred purchase price recorded 456 324 1,819 889 1 Receivables net of allowance, imputed interest and trade-in right guarantees. The deferred purchase price was initially recorded at estimated fair value, which was based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected, adjusted by the expected timing and value of device trade-ins, and is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6). During the third quarter of 2015, we repurchased installment receivables previously sold to the Purchasers , with a fair value of $412 . This transaction reduced our current deferred purchase price receivable by $314, resulting in a gain of $98 in the third quarter of 2015. This gain is included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. At September 30, 2015, our deferred purchase price receivable was $ 2,869 , of which $ 1,676 is included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d At December 31, 2014, our deferred purchase price receivable was $1,606, which is included in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the amount of our deferred purchase price at any point in time. The sales of equipment installment receivables did not have a material impact in our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the cash flows related to the arrangement as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale of the receivables and the collection of the deferred purchase price is not subject to significant interest rate risk.",

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates , including the results of DIRECTV for the 68-day period ended September 30, 2015 . Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications and digital entertainment services industry , providing services and equ ipment that deliver voice, video and broadband services domestically and internationally . All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one month of our period end. We also recorded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including actuarial gains and losses on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and cumulative translation adjustments . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation , including our presentation of \u201cEquipment\u201d and \u201cBroadcast, programming and operations\u201d expenses separately f rom other cost of services in the consolidated statements of income. Due to recent organizational changes and our July 24, 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we are revising our operating segments to align with the new management structure and or ganizational responsibilities.

                "value": "Customer Fulfillment Costs In August 2015, with our acquisition of DIRECTV, we announced a change in accounting for customer set-up and installation costs. Historically we have followed an accounting polic y of deferring customer set-up and installation costs only to the extent of deferred revenues recorded for upfront fees (e.g., activation charges), and to expense any costs that exce ed deferred revenues. After discussing this change with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we changed our accounting to a preferable method of capitalizing these costs and amortizing them over the expected economic life of the customer relationship of approximately four years, subject to an assessment of the recoverability of such costs. This change in accounting principle impacts video, broadband Internet and wireline voice services and is considered prefe rable in that it provides an accurate reflection of assets (i.e., the contractual customer relationship obtained through the set-up and installation) generated by those specific business activities. Our new accounting method is more comparable with the accounting method used in the cable entertainment industry. With our acquisition of DIRECTV, changing to this accounting method will enhance comparability to other companies in the industry . This change in accounting does not have an impact on our wireless results , due to the absence of these types of expenses in those business activities . ",

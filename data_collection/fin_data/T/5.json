PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as \u201cAT&T,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany.\u201d These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 20 1 5 . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, including the results of DIRECTV and wireless properties in Mexico for the pe riod from acquisition to the reporting date . Our subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the communications and digital entertainment services industry, providing services and equipment that deliver voice, video and broadband services domestically and internationally. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included for periods ended within up to one quarter of our period end. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive inco me (OCI) items, including cumulative translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of probable losses and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cert ain amounts have been conform ed to the current perio d' s presentation, including our change in accounting to capitalize customer set-up and inst allations costs and amortize them over the expected economic life of the customer relationship . The consolidated statements of income also include revisions to present \u201cEquipment\u201d and \u201cBroadcast, programming and ope rations\u201d costs separately from \u201cO ther cost of services . \u201d New Accounting Standards Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-0 2 , \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d (ASU 2016-0 2 ), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-0 2 will require lessees to recognize most leases o n their balance sheets as liabilities, with correspo nding \u201cright-of-use\u201d assets. Leases will be classified as eithe r a finance or an operating lease with out relying upon the bright-line tests under current GAAP. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key ch ange upon adoption will be the balance sheet recognition . The inc ome statement recognition appear s si milar to our current methodology . ASU 2016-0 2 becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, subject to early adopti on . We have just begun our evalua tion of the impact on our financial statements, as well as available adoption methods, but we believe our implementation of the revenue recognition standard discussed below could influence the timing of our adoption of ASU 2016-0 2 . Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASU 2014-09) and has since modified the standard with ASU 2015-14, \u201c Deferral of the Effective Date, \u201d ASU 2016-08, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d and ASU 2016-10, \u201cRevenue from Contr acts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Perform ance Obligations and Licensing.\u201d T hese standards replace existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-09 , as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard . The FASB allows two adoption methods under ASU 2014-09. Under one method, a company will apply the rules to contracts in all reporting periods presented, subject to certain allowable exceptions. Under the other method, a company will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the cha nge and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules (\u201cmodified retrospective method\u201d) . W e continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods . Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key changes in the standard that impact our revenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues between various services and eq uipment, and the timing of when those revenues are recognized. We are still in the process of evaluat ing the se impact s. A s a result of our accounti ng policy change for customer set-up and installation costs in 2015, we believe under the new standard that the re qui rement to defer such costs will not result in a significant change to our results. H owever, the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the contract period or expected customer life will result in the recognition of a deferr ed charge on our balance sheets. We cannot currently estimate the impact of this change upon adoption , as the industry continues to undergo changes in how devices and services are sold to customers . ",

                "value": "NOTE 4. SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. Due to recent organizational changes and our July 24, 2015 , acquisition of DIRECTV, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we revised our operating segments to align with our new management structure and organizational responsibilities. We analyze our operating segments based on segment contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items (as discussed below), and equity in net income of affiliates for investments managed within each operating segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Business Solutions, (2) Entertainment Group, (3) Consumer Mobility and (4) International. We also evaluate segment performance based on segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate segment operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. The Business Solutions segment provides services to business, including multinational companies; governmental and wholesale customers; and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through employer-sponsored plans. We provide advanced IP-based services including Virtual Private Networks (VPN); Ethernet-related products and broadband, collectively referred to as strategic business services; as well as traditional data and voice products. We utilize our wireless and wired networks (referred to as \u201cwired\u201d or \u201cwireline\u201d) to provide a complete communications solution to our business customers. The Entertainment Group segment provides video, Internet, voice communication and interactive and targeted advertising services to customers located in the U.S. or in U.S. territories. We utilize our copper and IP-based wired network and/or our satellite technology. The Consumer Mobility segment provides nationwid e wireless service to consumers and wireless wholesale and resale subscribers located in the U.S. or in U.S. territories. We utilize our U.S. wireless network to provide voice and data services, including high-spe ed Internet, video, and home monitoring services. The International segment provides entertainment services in Latin America and wireless services in Mexico. Video entertainment services are provided to primarily residential customers using satellite technology. We utilize our regional and national networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. Our international subsidiaries conduct business in their local currency and operating results are converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates. In reconciling items to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, Corporate and Other includes: (1) operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, and (2) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Certain operating items are not allocated to our business segments: Acquisition-related items include (1) operations and support items associated with the merger and integration of newly acquired businesses, and (2) the noncash amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Certain significant items include (1) noncash actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, (2) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (3) losses resulting from abandonment or impairment of assets and (4) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. I nterest expense and other income (expense) \u2013 net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, these items are also not included in each segment's reportable results. Our operating assets are utilized by multiple segments and consist of our wireless and wired networks as well as an international satellite fleet.

We also provide certain medical, dental , life insurance and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs . Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient t o provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. In 2013, we made a voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility II LLC, the primary holding company for our domestic wireless business, to the trust used to pay pension benefits under our qualified pension plans. The preferred equity interest had a fair value of $ 8,787 at March 31, 201 6 . The trust is entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions of $560 per annum, which will be distributed quarterly in equal amounts and will be accounted for as contributions. We distributed $140 to the trust during the three months ended March 31, 201 6 . So long as we make the distributions, we will have no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend or repurchase shares. This preferred equity interest is a plan asset under ERISA and is recognized as such in the plan's separate financial statements. However, because the preferred equity interest is not unconditionally transferable to an unrelated party, it is not reflected in plan assets in our consolidated financial statements and instead has been eliminated in consolidation . We have also agreed to make a cash contribution to the trust of $175 no later than the due date of our federal income tax return for 201 5 . We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our operating results at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. The following table details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. A portion of these expenses is capitalized as part of internal construction projects , providing a small reduction in the net expense recorded.

We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans.

            "Fair Value Measurements And Disclosure": {
                "value": "NOTE 6 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is often based on developed models in which there are few, if any, external observations. The fair value measurement s level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2015 . Long-Term Debt and Other Financial Instruments The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows: March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Notes and debentures 1 $ 129,229 $ 137,865 $ 124,847 $ 128,993 Bank borrowings 4 4 4 4 Investment securities 2,592 2,592 2,704 2,704 1 Includes credit agreement borrowings. The carrying value of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates market value. The fair value measurement s used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. The carrying and fair values included above reflect our March 2016 debt exchange of $16,049 of DIRECTV notes for AT&T global notes with matching terms. Following is the fair value leveling for available-for-sale securities and derivatives as of March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 : March 31, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-Sale Securities Domestic equities $ 1,111 $ - $ - $ 1,111 International equities 541 - - 541 Fixed income bonds - 676 - 676 Asset Derivatives 1 Interest rate swaps - 197 - 197 Cross-currency swaps - 519 - 519 Liability Derivatives 1 Cross-currency swaps - (2,582) - (2,582) 1 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as \"Other assets,\" \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" and, for a portion of interest rate swaps, \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated balance sheets.

Investment Securities Our investment securities include equities, fixed income bonds and other securities. A substantial portion of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities was estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated OCI. Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d with the corresponding reduction to the carrying basis of the investment. Fixed income investments of $ 99 have maturities of less than one year, $ 308 within one to three years, $ 65 within three to five years, and $ 204 for five or more years. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments ( certificate and time deposits ) and customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments and customer deposits are recorded in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative transaction s to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. Fair Value Hedging We designate our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. Accrued and realized gains or losses from interest rate swaps impact interest expense i n the consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as assets, and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Changes in the fair value s of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt . Gains or losses realized upon early termination of our fair value hedges are recognized in interest expense. In the three months ended March 31, 2016 , and March 31, 2015 , no ineffectiveness was measured on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges . Cash Flow Hedging We designate our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generate d from the issuance of our Euro, British pound sterling , Canadian dollar and Swiss f ranc denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign currency denominations to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating f oreign currency -denominated rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion is reported as a component of accumulated OCI until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income in each period. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swaps each quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2016 , and March 31, 2015 , no ineffectiveness was measured on cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a material amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income . Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $ 59 from accumulated OCI to interest expense due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks. We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we often enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. Gains and losses at the time we settle or take delivery on our designated foreign exchange contracts are amortized into income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, except where an amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to \u201cO ther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income . In the three months ended March 31, 2016 , and March 31, 2015 , no ineffectiveness was measured on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At March 31, 2016 , we had posted collateral of $1,743 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $111 (a receipt liability) . Under the agreements, if our credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Ratings , before the final collateral exchange in March , we would have been required to post additional collateral of $ 130 . If DIRECTV Holdings LLC's credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P) and below Baa3 (Moody's) , we would owe an additional $195. At December 31, 2015 , we had posted collateral of $2,343 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $124 (a receipt liability) . We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists , against the fair value of the derivative instruments. Following is the notional amount of our outstanding derivative positions: March 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Interest rate swaps $ 7,050 $ 7,050 Cross-currency swaps 29,642 29,642 Foreign exchange contracts 3 100 Total $ 36,695 $ 36,792 Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance: Effect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value Hedging Relationships Three months ended March 31, March 31, 2016 2015 Interest rate swaps (Interest expense): Gain (Loss) on interest rate swaps $ 66 $ 41 Gain (Loss) on long-term debt (66) (41) In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the quarter ended March 31 were offset against interest expense.

ACQU IS I TIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Acquisitions DIRECTV In July 2015 , we completed our acquisition of DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. For accounting purposes, the transaction was valued at $47,409. Our operating results include the results of DIRECTV following the acquisition date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition (see Note 6 ). The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting of acquired customer relationships, orbital slots and trade names. The income approach estimates fair value for an asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used primarily for property , plant and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value estimates are preliminary in nature and subject to adjustments, which could be material. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. Substantially all the receivables acquired are expected to be collectable. We have not identified any material unrecorded pre-acquisition contingencies where the related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and represents the future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of acquisition. Prior to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, if information becomes available that would indicate it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the final purchase price allocation and may change goodwill. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the DIRECTV assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes that existed as of the acquisition date. Assets acquired Cash $ 4,797 Accounts receivable 2,026 All other current assets 1,535 Property, plant and equipment 9,331 Intangible assets not subject to amortization Orbital slots 11,946 Trade name 1,371 Intangible assets subject to amortization Customer lists and relationships 19,508 Trade name 2,915 Other 457 Investments and other assets 2,388 Goodwill 34,449 Total assets acquired 90,723 Liabilities assumed Current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt 5,733 Long-term debt 20,585 Other noncurrent liabilities 16,642 Total liabilities assumed 42,960 Net assets acquired 47,763 Noncontrolling interest (354) Aggregate value of consideration paid $ 47,409 Purchased goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to our Entertainment Group and International segments. Nextel Mexico In April 2015 , we completed our acquisition of the subsidiaries of NII Holdings Inc., operating its wireless business in Mexico, for $1,875, including approximately $427 of net debt and other adjustments. The subsidiaries offered service under the name Nextel Mexico. The purchase price allocation of assets acquired w as : $376 in licenses, $1,167 in property, plant and equipment, $128 in customer lists and $19 3 of goodwill. The goodwill was allocated to our International segment. GSF Telecom In January 2015 , we acquired Mexican wireless company GSF Telecom Holdings, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (GSF Telecom) for $2,500, including net debt of approximately $700. GSF Telecom offered service under both the Iusacell and Unefon brand names in Mexico. The purchase price allocation of assets acquired w as : $735 in licenses, $658 in property, plant and equipment, $378 in customer lists, $26 in trade names and $95 6 of goodwill. The goodwill was allocated to our International segment. AWS-3 Auction In January 2015, we submitted winning bids of $18,189 in the Advan c ed Wireless Service ( AWS ) -3 Auction (FCC Auction 97) a portion of which represented spectrum clearing and First Responder Network Authority funding . We provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) an initial down payment of $921 in October 2014 and paid the remaining $17,268 in the first quarter of 2015. ",

SALES OF EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT RECEIVABLES We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 30 months, with the right to trade in the original equipment for a new device within a set period and have the remaining unpaid balance satisfied. As of March 31, 201 6 , and December 31, 201 5 , gross equipment installment receivables of $ 5,079 and $ 5,719 were included on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 3,007 and $3,239 are notes receivable that are included in \u201cAccounts receivable - net.\u201d In 2014, we entered into the first of a series of uncommitted agreements pertaining to the sale of equipment installment receivables and related security with Citibank and various other relationship banks as purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers). Under these agreements, we transferred the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price. Under the terms of the arrangements, we continue to bill and collect on behalf of our customers for the receivables sold. The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: Three months ended March 31, 2016 2015 Gross receivables sold $ 2,482 $ 2,635 Net receivables sold 1 2,256 2,381 Cash proceeds received 1,521 1,524 Deferred purchase price recorded 719 858 1 Receivables net of allowance, imputed interest and trade-in right guarantees. The deferred purchase price i s initially recorded a t estimated fair value, which i s based on remaining i nstallment payments expected to be collected, adjusted by the expected timing and v alue of device trade-ins, and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties that contemplate changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 6). During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased installment receivables previously sold to the Purchasers, with a fair value of $532. These transactions reduced our current deferred purchase price receivable by $539, resulting in a loss of $7 during the quarter. This loss is included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d in the consolidated statements of income. At March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , our deferred purchase price receivable was $ 2,975 and $2,961, respectively, of which $ 1,469 and $1,772 is included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the amount of our deferred purchase price at any point in time. The sales of equipment installment receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the cash flows related to the arrangement as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale of the receivables and the collection of the deferred purchase price is not subject to significant interest rate risk.",

                "value": "New Accounting Standards Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-0 2 , \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d (ASU 2016-0 2 ), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-0 2 will require lessees to recognize most leases o n their balance sheets as liabilities, with correspo nding \u201cright-of-use\u201d assets. Leases will be classified as eithe r a finance or an operating lease with out relying upon the bright-line tests under current GAAP. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key ch ange upon adoption will be the balance sheet recognition . The inc ome statement recognition appear s si milar to our current methodology . ASU 2016-0 2 becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, subject to early adopti on . We have just begun our evalua tion of the impact on our financial statements, as well as available adoption methods, but we believe our implementation of the revenue recognition standard discussed below could influence the timing of our adoption of ASU 2016-0 2 . Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (ASU 2014-09) and has since modified the standard with ASU 2015-14, \u201c Deferral of the Effective Date, \u201d ASU 2016-08, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d and ASU 2016-10, \u201cRevenue from Contr acts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Perform ance Obligations and Licensing.\u201d T hese standards replace existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-09 , as amended, becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, at which point we plan to adopt the standard . The FASB allows two adoption methods under ASU 2014-09. Under one method, a company will apply the rules to contracts in all reporting periods presented, subject to certain allowable exceptions. Under the other method, a company will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the cha nge and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules (\u201cmodified retrospective method\u201d) . W e continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods . Upon initial evaluation, we believe the key changes in the standard that impact our revenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues between various services and eq uipment, and the timing of when those revenues are recognized. We are still in the process of evaluat ing the se impact s. A s a result of our accounti ng policy change for customer set-up and installation costs in 2015, we believe under the new standard that the re qui rement to defer such costs will not result in a significant change to our results. H owever, the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the contract period or expected customer life will result in the recognition of a deferr ed charge on our balance sheets. We cannot currently estimate the impact of this change upon adoption , as the industry continues to undergo changes in how devices and services are sold to customers . ",

                "value": "Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies We were incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. On October 29, 2014, we sold the Motorola Mobile business (Motorola Mobile) to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo). The financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as net loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . See Note 8 for further discussion of the sale. On August 10, 2015, we announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet), and a new operating structure. On October 2, 2015, we announced the implementation of the holding company reorganization, in which Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2015 , the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 , the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 , and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2015 , our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 , and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 . The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2015 . These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 , filed with the SEC on February 6, 2015. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in \u201cRevenue Recognition (Topic 605)\u201d, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) \"Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation\". ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities. The additional elimination of related consolidation guidance will require companies with interests in development stage entities to reassess whether such entities are variable interest entities under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 will be applied retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein. Early application of these amendments is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-10 on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02) \"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\" ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on our consolidated financial statements. Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements In the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million . We evaluated the materiality of the income tax expense impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior periods impacted and that correction of income tax expense as an out of period adjustment in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 would not be material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2015. Consolidated revenues are not impacted. We elected to revise previously issued consolidated financial statements for the periods impacted. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.",

                "value": "Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. We classify our non-marketable investments within Level 3 as the valuation inputs are not observable in an active market. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 (in millions): As of December 31, 2014 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Cash $ 9,863 $ 0 $ 0 $ 9,863 $ 9,863 $ 0 Level 1: Money market and other funds 2,532 0 0 2,532 2,532 0 U.S. government notes 15,320 37 (4 ) 15,353 1,128 14,225 Marketable equity securities 988 428 (64 ) 1,352 0 1,352 18,840 465 (68 ) 19,237 3,660 15,577 Level 2: Time deposits (1) 2,409 0 0 2,409 2,309 100 Money market and other funds (2) 1,762 0 0 1,762 1,762 0 Fixed-income bond funds (3) 385 0 (38 ) 347 0 347 U.S. government agencies 2,327 8 (1 ) 2,334 750 1,584 Foreign government bonds 1,828 22 (10 ) 1,840 0 1,840 Municipal securities 3,370 33 (6 ) 3,397 3 3,394 Corporate debt securities 11,499 114 (122 ) 11,491 0 11,491 Agency mortgage-backed securities 8,196 109 (42 ) 8,263 0 8,263 Asset-backed securities 3,456 1 (5 ) 3,452 0 3,452 35,232 287 (224 ) 35,295 4,824 30,471 Total $ 63,935 $ 752 $ (292 ) $ 64,395 $ 18,347 $ 46,048 As of September 30, 2015 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable (unaudited) Cash $ 10,986 $ 0 $ 0 $ 10,986 $ 10,986 $ 0 Level 1: Money market and other funds 3,668 0 0 3,668 3,668 0 U.S. government notes 18,146 114 0 18,260 0 18,260 Marketable equity securities 1,014 196 (315 ) 895 0 895 22,828 310 (315 ) 22,823 3,668 19,155 Level 2: Time deposits (1) 3,434 0 0 3,434 1,458 1,976 Money market and other funds (2) 1,855 0 0 1,855 1,855 0 Fixed-income bond funds (3) 370 0 (84 ) 286 0 286 U.S. government agencies 1,331 6 0 1,337 100 1,237 Foreign government bonds 2,422 17 (23 ) 2,416 0 2,416 Municipal securities 3,629 37 (4 ) 3,662 0 3,662 Corporate debt securities 13,536 79 (239 ) 13,376 1 13,375 Agency mortgage-backed securities 9,434 101 (24 ) 9,511 0 9,511 Asset-backed securities 3,084 2 (5 ) 3,081 0 3,081 39,095 242 (379 ) 38,958 3,414 35,544 Total $ 72,909 $ 552 $ (694 ) $ 72,767 $ 18,068 $ 54,699 (1) The majority of our time deposits are foreign deposits. (2) The balances as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 were related to cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See section titled \" Securities Lending Program \" below for further discussion of this program. (3) Fixed-income bond funds consist of mutual funds that primarily invest in corporate and government bonds. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $33 million and $189 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $54 million and $235 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 . We recognized gross realized losses of $15 million and $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $60 million and $156 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 . We reflect these gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions): As of (unaudited) Due in 1 year $ 8,525 Due in 1 year through 5 years 27,725 Due in 5 years through 10 years 7,244 Due after 10 years 10,024 Total $ 53,518 Non-marketable Investments We included $90 million and $991 million of available-for-sale debt securities in our non-marketable investments as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . These debt securities are primarily preferred stock with certain features and convertible notes issued by private companies that do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of the private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. As of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 , the estimated fair value of these debt securities approximated their carrying value. In addition, since these securities do not have contractual maturity dates and we do not intend to liquidate them in the next 12 months, we have classified them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . The following table presents reconciliations for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions): Level 3 (unaudited) Balance as of December 31, 2014 $ 90 Purchases, issuances, and settlements (1) 901 Balance as of September 30, 2015 $ 991 (1) Purchases of securities included our $900 million investment in SpaceX, a space exploration and space transport company, made during January 2015. Impairment Considerations for Available-for-sale Investments The following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those marketable investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 , aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions): As of December 31, 2014 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized U.S. government notes $ 4,490 $ (4 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,490 $ (4 ) U.S. government agencies 830 (1 ) 0 0 830 (1 ) Foreign government bonds 255 (7 ) 43 (3 ) 298 (10 ) Municipal securities 877 (3 ) 174 (3 ) 1,051 (6 ) Corporate debt securities 5,851 (112 ) 225 (10 ) 6,076 (122 ) Agency mortgage-backed securities 609 (1 ) 2,168 (41 ) 2,777 (42 ) Asset-backed securities 2,388 (4 ) 174 (1 ) 2,562 (5 ) Fixed-income bond funds 347 (38 ) 0 0 347 (38 ) Marketable equity securities 690 (64 ) 0 0 690 (64 ) Total $ 16,337 $ (234 ) $ 2,784 $ (58 ) $ 19,121 $ (292 ) As of September 30, 2015 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized (unaudited) Foreign government bonds $ 873 $ (19 ) $ 27 $ (4 ) $ 900 $ (23 ) Municipal securities 356 (3 ) 23 (1 ) 379 (4 ) Corporate debt securities 7,152 (187 ) 651 (52 ) 7,803 (239 ) Agency mortgage-backed securities 1,355 (8 ) 739 (16 ) 2,094 (24 ) Asset-backed securities 1,650 (4 ) 230 (1 ) 1,880 (5 ) Fixed-income bond funds 0 0 286 (84 ) 286 (84 ) Marketable equity securities 790 (315 ) 0 0 790 (315 ) Total $ 12,176 $ (536 ) $ 1,956 $ (158 ) $ 14,132 $ (694 ) We periodically review our available-for-sale debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 , we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss. Securities Lending Program From time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan certain securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is usually invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default. Our securities lending transactions were accounted for as secured borrowings with significant investment categories as follows (in millions): As of September 30, 2015 Remaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements Securities Lending Transactions Overnight and Continuous Up to 30 days 30 - 90 Days Greater Than 90 Days Total (unaudited) U.S. government notes $ 1,779 $ 1,001 $ 0 $ 101 $ 2,881 U.S. government agencies 192 0 0 0 192 Corporate debt securities 193 0 0 0 193 Total $ 2,164 $ 1,001 $ 0 $ 101 $ 3,266 Gross amount of recognized liabilities for securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 3,266 Amounts related to agreements not included in securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 0 Derivative Financial Instruments We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below. We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and our anticipated debt issuance. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 , we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $268 million and $105 million . Cash Flow Hedges We use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $13.6 billion and $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less. In 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate, that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014. We issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in February 2014 (see details in Note 3). As a result, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swaps upon the debt issuance. The gain associated with the termination is reported within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , consistent with the impact of the hedged item. We reflect gains or losses on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to interest and other income, net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in interest and other income, net. As of September 30, 2015 , the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $556 million , of which $466 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in the time value for these forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . We use interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $175 million and $290 million as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . Gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. Cash flows from these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are reported within investment activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the impact of the hedged items. Other Derivatives Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $6.2 billion and $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and \u201cTo Be Announced\u201d (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $150 million as of December 31, 2014 and $450 million as of September 30, 2015 . The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2014 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative Assets: Level 2: Foreign exchange contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current $ 851 $ 0 $ 851 Interest rate contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current 1 0 1 Total $ 852 $ 0 $ 852 Derivative Liabilities: Level 2: Foreign exchange contracts Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 0 $ 3 $ 3 Interest rate contracts Accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current 1 0 1 Total $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 As of September 30, 2015 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Total Fair Value (unaudited) Derivative Assets: Level 2: Foreign exchange contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current $ 545 $ 1 $ 546 Total $ 545 $ 1 $ 546 Derivative Liabilities: Level 2: Foreign exchange contracts Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 0 $ 3 $ 3 Interest rate contracts Accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current 6 1 7 Total $ 6 $ 4 $ 10 The effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income (OCI) is summarized below (in millions): Gains (Losses) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Before Tax Effect (Effective Portion) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship 2014 2015 2014 2015 (unaudited) Foreign exchange contracts $ 436 $ 97 $ 458 $ 813 Interest rate contracts 0 0 (31 ) 0 Total $ 436 $ 97 $ 427 $ 813 Gains Reclassified from AOCI into Income (Effective Portion) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship Income Statement Location 2014 2015 2014 2015 (unaudited) Foreign exchange contracts Revenues $ 10 $ 286 $ 24 $ 1,068 Interest rate contracts Interest and other income, net 1 1 2 3 Total $ 11 $ 287 $ 26 $ 1,071 Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives (1) (Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship Income Statement Location 2014 2015 2014 2015 (unaudited) Foreign exchange contracts Interest and other income, net $ (52 ) $ (63 ) $ (186 ) $ (230 ) Interest rate contracts Interest and other income, net 0 0 4 0 Total $ (52 ) $ (63 ) $ (182 ) $ (230 ) (1) Gains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.

Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 , we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in July 2016 . The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 , we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . Our short-term debt balance also includes the short-term portion of certain long-term debt, as described in the section below. Long-Term Debt We issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the \"2014 Notes\") in February 2014 and $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the \"2011 Notes\") in May 2011. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes.

The effective interest yields of the Notes due in 2016, 2021, and 2024 were 2.241% , 3.734% and 3.377% , respectively. Interest on the 2011 and 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually. The 2011 and 2014 Notes rank equally with each other and with all of our other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. We may redeem the 2011 and 2014 Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the 2011 Notes or the 2014 Notes. The total estimated fair value of the outstanding 2011 and 2014 Notes was approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . The fair value of the outstanding 2011 and 2014 Notes was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property which expires in 2028. We intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in 2016, and as such the long term portion of the capital lease obligation was reclassified as short term. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate.

                "value": "Contingencies Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results. The EC also opened a formal investigation into Android. We responded to the SO on August 27, 2015 and will continue to cooperate with the EC. The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), the Canadian Competition Bureau (CCB), and the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of the Russian Federation have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In August 2015, we received the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. In September 2015, FAS found that there has been a competition law infringement in Android mobile distribution. We will respond to the CCI's report and are considering an appeal of the FAS decision. In July 2015, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigations of our business practices. The state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Other We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences. Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Taxes We are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it would result in a further charge to expense. Please see Note 13 for additional information regarding contingencies related to our income taxes.",

The Stock Split had a record date of March 27, 2014 and a payment date of April 2, 2014. In the second quarter of 2015, in accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute Class C capital stock, at the close of trading on April 2, 2015, the last trading day of the 365 day period following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (Lookback Period), we determined that a payment (the Adjustment Payment) in the amount of $522 million was due to Class C capital stockholders. The amount of the Adjustment Payment was based on the percentage difference that developed between the volume-weighted average price of Class A and Class C shares during the Lookback Period, as supplied by NASDAQ Data-on-Demand, and was payable to holders of Class C capital stock as of the end of the Lookback Period in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of our board of directors. On April 22, 2015, our board of directors approved the Adjustment Payment in shares of Class C capital stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Class C capital stock. In May 2015, the Adjustment Payment was made, resulting in the issuance of approximately 853 thousand shares of Class C capital stock and $47 million of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class C capital stock. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , the Adjustment Payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. The weighted-average share impact of the Adjustment Payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and three months ended September 30, 2015 , the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.",

                "value": "Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $3,294 million and $3,918 million as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $2,909 million and $3,385 million as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 . Our existing tax positions will continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. We have received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend against any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters. On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost-sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. The opinion is subject to being issued as a final decision and is also subject to appeal by the Internal Revenue Service. The net impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.

In October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015.

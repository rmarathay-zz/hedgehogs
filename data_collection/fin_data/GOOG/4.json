                "value": "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2015. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. On October 2, 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization in which Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google Inc. (Google) that was accounted for as a merger under common control. Alphabet has recognized the assets and liabilities of Google at carryover basis. The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet present comparative information for the prior periods on a combined basis, as if both Alphabet and Google were under common control for all periods presented. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alphabet Inc., our subsidiaries, as well as all variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 , the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 , the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 , and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of June 30, 2016 , our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 , and our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 . The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 . These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 , filed with the SEC on February 11, 2016 as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2016. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience, future projections, market transactions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes, as well as, on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in \u201cRevenue Recognition (Topic 605)\u201d, and requires entities to recognize revenue when they transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, implementing accounting system changes related to the adoption, and considering additional disclosure requirements. In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the recognition and measurement for equity investments. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 will impact the disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted only for certain provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02) which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created Topic 842, \"Leases.\" Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provides for enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited and early adoption by public entities is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.",

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions, unaudited): As of Due in 1 year $ 7,302 Due in 1 year through 5 years 36,934 Due in 5 years through 10 years 8,374 Due after 10 years 11,793 Total $ 64,403 Impairment Considerations for Marketable Investments The following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those marketable investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions): As of December 31, 2015 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized U.S. government notes $ 13,757 $ (48 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 13,757 $ (48 ) U.S. government agencies 864 (3 ) 0 0 864 (3 ) Foreign government bonds 885 (18 ) 36 (5 ) 921 (23 ) Municipal securities 1,116 (3 ) 41 (1 ) 1,157 (4 ) Corporate debt securities 9,192 (202 ) 784 (76 ) 9,976 (278 ) Agency mortgage-backed securities 5,783 (34 ) 721 (23 ) 6,504 (57 ) Asset-backed securities 2,508 (7 ) 386 (1 ) 2,894 (8 ) Total $ 34,105 $ (315 ) $ 1,968 $ (106 ) $ 36,073 $ (421 ) As of June 30, 2016 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized (unaudited) Foreign government bonds $ 302 $ (1 ) $ 66 $ (4 ) $ 368 $ (5 ) Municipal securities 301 (2 ) 61 (1 ) 362 (3 ) Corporate debt securities 1,841 (28 ) 897 (40 ) 2,738 (68 ) Agency mortgage-backed securities 660 (2 ) 389 (3 ) 1,049 (5 ) Asset-backed securities 0 0 298 (2 ) 298 (2 ) Total $ 3,104 $ (33 ) $ 1,711 $ (50 ) $ 4,815 $ (83 ) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 , we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 , we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , we recognized $87 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to our marketable equity securities. Those losses are included in gains (losses) on marketable securities, net, as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 8 for further details on other income (expense), net. Securities Lending Program From time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan certain securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is usually invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default. Our securities lending transactions were accounted for as secured borrowings with significant investment categories as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2015 Remaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements Securities Lending Transactions Overnight and Continuous Up to 30 days 30 - 90 Days Greater Than 90 Days Total U.S. government notes $ 1,322 $ 31 $ 0 $ 306 $ 1,659 U.S. government agencies 504 77 0 0 581 Corporate debt securities 188 0 0 0 188 Total $ 2,014 $ 108 $ 0 $ 306 $ 2,428 Gross amount of recognized liabilities for securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 2,428 Amounts related to agreements not included in securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 0 As of June 30, 2016 Remaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements Securities Lending Transactions Overnight and Continuous Up to 30 days 30 - 90 Days Greater Than 90 Days Total (unaudited) U.S. government notes $ 969 $ 82 $ 0 $ 102 $ 1,153 U.S. government agencies 564 128 0 0 692 Corporate debt securities 220 0 0 0 220 Total $ 1,753 $ 210 $ 0 $ 102 $ 2,065 Gross amount of recognized liabilities for securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 2,065 Amounts related to agreements not included in securities lending in offsetting disclosure $ 0 Derivative Financial Instruments We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as other income (expense), net, revenues, or accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below. We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $192 million and $150 million . Cash Flow Hedges We use options to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and at times we use interest rate swaps to effectively lock interest rates on anticipated debt issuances. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $16.4 billion and $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively. These contracts have maturities of 36 months or less. We reflect gains or losses on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in other income (expense), net. As of June 30, 2016 , the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $313 million , of which $255 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude the difference between spot rates and forward rates for these forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively. We have used interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $295 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively. Gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. Cash flows from these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are reported within investment activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the impact of the hedged items. Other Derivatives Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $7.5 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively. We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and \u201cTo Be Announced\u201d (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into other income (expense), net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $50 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively.

                "value": "Non-Marketable Investments Our non-marketable investments include non-marketable equity investments and non-marketable debt securities. Non-Marketable Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method and are not required to be consolidated under the variable interest or voting models. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments was a net loss of approximately $59 million and $89 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and $43 million and $148 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 . We reflect these losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion , respectively, and a fair value of approximately $7.5 billion and $8.1 billion , respectively. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging private-market transactions and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment. No material impairments were recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 . Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments are variable interest entities (VIEs). Our involvement with investments in renewable energy relate to our equity investments in entities whose activities involve power generation. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the entity's economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. We account for these investments under the equity method. The carrying value of our renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method that are VIEs is $1.3 billion with the maximum exposure of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $1.3 billion with the maximum exposure of $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 , respectively. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date plus future funding commitments. We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in these entities. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs and vice versa, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. Non-Marketable Debt Securities Our non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies. The cost of these securities was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , respectively. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. No material impairments were recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 . The following table presents a reconciliation for our non-marketable debt securities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions, unaudited): Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2016 Beginning balance $ 90 $ 1,024 Total net gains or losses Included in other comprehensive income 0 90 Purchases 908 76 Sales 0 (6 ) Settlements 0 (14 ) Ending balance $ 998 $ 1,170",

In February 2016, we replaced Google's existing debt financing program with a new short-term debt financing program that allows us to issue up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper from time to time and to draw on a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2021. Net proceeds from these programs are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 , we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.2% and 0.5% , respectively. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 . The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 . In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property which expires in 2028. We intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in the second half of 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 . Long-Term Debt Google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the \"2011 Notes\") in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the \"2014 Notes\") in February 2014 due 2024. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes were used for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. We repaid $1.0 billion of the 2011 Notes in May 2016. In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google\u2019s 3.625% Notes due 2021 and 3.375% Notes due 2024 (collectively, the \"Google Notes\"). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of the notes of Alphabet with identical interest rate and maturity (the \"Alphabet Notes\"). Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gains or losses recognized. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions): As of As of (unaudited) Short-Term Portion of Long-Term Debt 2.125% Notes due on May 19, 2016 $ 1,000 $ 0 Capital Lease Obligation 225 220 Total Short-Term Portion of Long-Term Debt $ 1,225 $ 220 Long-Term Debt 3.625% Notes due on May 19, 2021 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.375% Notes due on February 25, 2024 1,000 1,000 Unamortized discount for the Notes above (5 ) (16 ) Total Long-Term Debt (1) $ 1,995 $ 1,984 (1) Includes portion of the Google Notes issued in 2011 and 2014 and the Alphabet Notes exchanged in 2016.

The Alphabet Notes due in 2021 and 2024 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinated to the Google Notes. We may redeem these Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 . The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.",

                "value": "Contingencies Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search. We will respond to the SOs and Supplementary SO and will continue to cooperate with the EC. The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of the Russian Federation have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In August 2015, we received the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. In September 2015, FAS found that there has been a competition law infringement in Android mobile distribution. We will respond to the CCI's report and are appealing the FAS decision. The state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the case is pending post-trial motions and any further appeals by Oracle. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter. Other We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences. Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Indirect Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arise from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions. We accrue indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. For certain matters, while the loss is reasonably possible, the loss or range of loss cannot be estimated. We believe these matters are without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 . Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 . Our existing tax positions will continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust the provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. We have received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend against any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.

Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X, and other initiatives. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of Nest hardware products, internet and TV services through Google Fiber, and licensing and R&D services through Verily. Revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.

We measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes, as well as, on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ",

As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, implementing accounting system changes related to the adoption, and considering additional disclosure requirements. In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the recognition and measurement for equity investments. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 will impact the disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted only for certain provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02) which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created Topic 842, \"Leases.\" Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provides for enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited and early adoption by public entities is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.",

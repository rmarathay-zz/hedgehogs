                "value": "Note 2 : Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance provides companies with alternative methods of adoption. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial s tatements and our method of adoption. Consolidations In February 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to consolidation under the variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The updated accounting guidance modifies the consolidation guidance for VIEs, limited partnerships and similar legal entities. We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Financial A ssets and Financial Liabili ties In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equity investmen ts, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance requires a cum ulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings when the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements . Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short -term leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance . For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from previous guida nce. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of th e earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation In March 2016, the FASB u pdated the accounting guidance that affects several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The most significant change for us relates to the presentation of the income and withholding tax consequences of share-based compensation in our con solidated financial statements. Among the changes, the updated guidance requires that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise whe n the tax consequences of share- based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in th e statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also states that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flow s and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. In addition, the updated guidance requires when an employer withholds share s upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, that the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity. We currently record these amounts within operating activi ties. We will implement the updated guidance in the first quarter of 2017. As required under the updated guidance, we will prospectively adopt the provisions of this guidance related to the recognition of the excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the statement of income. In addition, upon adoption we will retrospectively adopt the provisions of this guidance related to changes to the statement of cash flows for all periods presented. If we had adopted the provisions of the updated guidance as of Ja nuary 1, 2016, it would have increased net income attributab le to Comcast Corporation by $34 million and $193 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In addition, the updated guidance would have increased net cash prov ided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by (used in) financing activities by $ 493 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The most significant impact of implementing the new guidance is expected to occur in the first quar ter of each year as a result of the vesting of restricted stock awards, which primarily occurs in March.",

                "value": "Note 2 : Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an e ntity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance provides companies with alternative methods of adoption. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accou nting guidance will have on our consolidated financial s tatements and our method of adoption. Consolidations In February 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to consolidation under the variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The updated accounting guidance modifies the consolidation guidance for VIEs, limited partnerships and similar legal entities. We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Financial Assets and Financial Liabil ities In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equity investme nts, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance requires a cu mulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings when the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement s. Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short- term leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance . For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from previous guidance. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation In March 2016, the F ASB updated the accounting guidance that affects several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The most significant change for us relates to the presentation of the income and withholding tax consequences of share-based compensation in ou r consolidated financial statements. Among the changes, the updated guidance requires that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise whe n the tax consequences of share- based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the stat ement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also states that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flow s and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. In addition, the updated guidance requires when an employer withholds shares upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, that the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity. We currently record these amounts within operating activities. We will implement the updated guidance in the first quarter of 2017 . As a limited liability company, we do not expect the updated accounting guidance related to the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies to be recognized in the statement of income to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we do not expect the updated accounting guidance to have a material impact on our statement of cash flows. ",

(\u201cDreamWorks\u201d) for $3.8 billion. DreamWorks\u2019 stockholders received $41 in cash for each share of DreamWorks common stock. DreamWorks creates animated feature films, television series and specials, live entertainment and related consumer products. The results of operations for DreamWorks are reported in our Filmed Entertainment segment following the acquisition date. The transaction is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities are to be recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisiti on date . Due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date, the assets and liabilities of DreamWorks were recorded based primarily on their historical carrying values. We recorded the debt we assumed from DreamWorks at its estimated fair value o f $381 million and we recorded a liability related to a tax receivable agreement that DreamWorks had previously entered into with one of its former stockholders (the \u201ctax receivable agreement\u201d) at its estimated fair value of $146 million. The fair value of the assumed debt was primarily based on quoted market values. The fair value of the tax receivable agreement was based on the contractual settlement provisions in the agreement and the value is subject to adjustment . In addition, we recorded deferred in come taxes based on our estimate of the tax basis of the acquired assets and valuation allowances based on the expected use of net operating loss carryforwards. The remaining assets and liabilities primarily consisted of goodwill and film and television co sts. We will adjust the remaining assets and liabilities to fair value and will record the related deferred income tax adjustments as valuations are completed and we obtain information necessary to complete the analyses, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. For purposes of the preliminary allocation of purchase price, the excess of the total transaction value over the recorded values of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The tax receivable agreement was settled immediate ly following the acquisition and the payment was recorded as an operating activity in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid all of the assumed debt of DreamWorks (see No te 8). Revenue and net income attributable to the acquisition of DreamWorks were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Universal Studios Japan is a VIE based on the governance structure and we consolidate Universal Studios Japan as we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or other financi al commitments between us and Universal Studios Japan, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is NBCUniversal\u2019s 51% interest.

We generate revenue from Comcast primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming , the fees received under retransmission consent agreements in our Broadcast Television segment and, to a lesser extent, the sale of advertising and our owned programming, and we incur expenses primarily related to advertising and various support services pr ovided by Comcast to us. In September 2016, as part of the Comcast cash management process, we and Comcast amended and restated our revolving credit agreements to increase the amount that we can borrow from Comcast and that Comcast can borrow from us from $3 billion to $5 billion and extend ed the maturity date to 2026. Amounts owed by us to Comcast or to us by Comcast under the revolving credit agreement, including accrued interest, are presented under the captio ns \u201cnote payable to Comcast\u201d and \u201cnote receiv able from Comcast,\u201d respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The revolving credit agreements bear interest at floating rates equal to the interest rate calculation under Comcast\u2019s revolving credit facility.

Following the close of the transaction, we continue to hold an investment in The Weather Channel cable network through a new holding company. As a result of the sale of our investment, we recognized a pretax gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $108 million in o ther income (expense), net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, The Weather Channel recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill. We recorded an expense of $252 million that represents NBCUniversal\u2019s proportionate share of this impairmen t charge in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in our condensed consolidated statement of income. Atairos In 2015, we entered into an agreement to establish Atairos Group, Inc. (\u201c Atairos \u201d), a strategic company focused on investing in and opera ting companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally . The agreement became effective as of January 1, 2016. Atairos has a term of up to 12 years and is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only investor other than our former CFO and the other management company employees. We have committed to fund up to $4 billion in the aggregate at any one time in Atairos , subject to certain offsets, and $40 million annually to fund a management fee, subject to certain adjustments, while the management company investors have committed to fund up to $100 million (with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continue d role with Atairos ). Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and provide us the right to receive approximately 86.5% of any residual returns in Atairos , in either case on a cumulative bas is. We have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a relate d party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for this investment as an equity method investment. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or other financial commitments between C omcast and Atairos , and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and remaining unfunded capital commitment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 , we made capital contributions totaling $ 399 million to Atairos . Hulu In August 2016, Time Warner Inc. acquired a 10% interest in Hulu, LLC (\u201cHulu\u201d), which diluted our interest in Hulu from 33% to 30%. For a period not to exceed three years, Time Warner may put its sh ares to Hulu or Hulu may call Time Warner\u2019s shares unde r certain limited circumstances arising from regulatory review.

For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , 2.8% of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franc hise and other regulatory fees. (b ) Beginning in the first quart er of 2016, certain operations and businesses, including several strategic business initiatives , that were previously presented in Corporate and Other are now presented in our Cable C ommunications segment to reflect a change in our management reporting presentation. For segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted all periods presented to reflect this change. (c) The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcas t of the 2016 Rio Olympics were reported in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments. The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 Super Bowl were reported in our Broadcast Television segment. (d) Begin ning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our method of accounting for a contractual obligation that involves an interest in the revenue of certain theme parks. As a result of the change, amounts payable based on current period revenue are presented i n operating costs and expenses. Amounts paid through the third quarter of 2015 were included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income. For segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted periods prior to the fourth quarter of 201 5 to reflect management reporting presentation for this expense on a consistent basis for all periods in the Theme Parks segment and total NBCUniversal, which resulted in a corresponding offsetting adjustment in Eliminations to reconcile to consolidated to tals. (e) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (f) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following:\n\u2022 our Cable Networks segment generates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount\n\u2022 our Broadcast Television segmen t generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with our Cable Communications segment\n\u2022 our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Netw orks segment\n\u2022 our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks segment (g) No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period. (h) We use operating income ( loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the sign ificant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structu re or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performanc e measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.",

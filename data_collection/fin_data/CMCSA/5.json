The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated accounting guidance i s effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance provides companies with alternative methods of adoption. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and our method of adoption. Consolidations In February 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to consolidation under the variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The updated accounting guidanc e modifies the consolidation guidance for VIEs, limited partnerships and similar legal entities. We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Financial A ssets and Financ ial Liabilities In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equit y investments, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance req uires a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings when the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the excepti on of short-term leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance . For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from pre vious guidance. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the begi nning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation In March 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance that affects several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The most significant change for us relates to the presentation of the income and withholding tax consequences of share-based compensation in our consolidated financial statements. Among the changes, the updated guidance requires that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise whe n the tax consequences of share- based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in th e statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also states that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flow s and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. In addition, the updated guidance requires when an employer withholds shares upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, that the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity. We currently record these amounts within operating activit ies. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance provides companies with alternative methods of adoption, with certain items that are allowed to be applied retrospectively and certai n other items that are only to be applied prospectively in the period of adoption. We are currently in the process of determining our method of adoption of this updated accounting guidance. If we had adopted all provisions of the updated guidance as of Jan uary 1, 20 16, it would have increased net income attributable to Comcast by $111 million and it would have increased net cash provided by operating activities and decrease d net cash provided by (used in) financing activities each by $289 million for the th ree months ended March 31, 2016. The most significant impact o f implementing the new guidance will occur in the first quarter of each year as a result of the vesting of restricted stock awards, which primarily occurs in March.",

The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an e ntity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer.

In addition, we do not expect the updated accounting guidance to have a material impact on our statement of cash flows. ",

As a result of the sale of our investment, we recognized a pretax gain of $108 million in other income (expense), net . Atairos In 2015, we entered into an agreement to establish Atairos Group, Inc. (\u201c Atairos \u201d), a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and busines s sectors, both domestically and internationally . The agreement became effective as of January 1, 2016. Atairos has a term of up to 12 years and is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting righ ts. We are the only investor other than our former CFO and the other management company employees. We have committed to fund up to $4 billion in the aggregate at any one time in Atairos , subject to certain offsets, and $40 million annually to fund a manage ment fee, subject to certain adjustments, while the management company investors have committed to fund up to $100 million (with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos ). Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and provide us the right to receive approximately 86.5% of any residual returns in Atairos , in either case on a cumulative basis. We have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that w e do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not related parties with our former CFO or the management compa nies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for this investment as an equity method investment. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos , and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and remaining unfunded capital commitment. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we provided capital contributions totaling $404 million to Atairos .

Level 1 consists of financial instruments whose values are based on quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market. Level 2 consists of financi al instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models use inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 consists of financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models that use sig nificant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, 2.9% and 2.8% , respectively, of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees. Beginning in the first quart er of 2016, certain operations and businesses, including several strategic business initiatives , that were previously presented in Corporate and Other are now presented in our Cable Communications segment to reflect a change in our management reporting presentation. For segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted all p eriods presented to reflect this change. The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 Super Bowl were reported in our Broadcast Television segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our method of accounting for a contractual obligation that involves an interest in the revenue of certain theme parks. As a result of the change, amounts payable based on current period revenue are presented in operating costs and expenses. Amounts paid through the thir d quarter of 2015 were included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income. For segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect management reporting presentation for this expen se on a consistent basis for all periods in the Theme Parks segment and total NBCUniversal, which resulted in a corresponding offsetting adjustment in Eliminations to reconcile to consolidated totals. NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following:\n\u2022 our Cable Networks segment gene rates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount\n\u2022 our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agr eements with our Cable Communications segment\n\u2022 our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment\n\u2022 our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments g enerate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks segment No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period. We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operat ing performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measur e is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure sh ould not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.",

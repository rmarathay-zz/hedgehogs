Level 1 consists of financial instruments whose values are based on quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market. Level 2 consists of financi al instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models use inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 consists of financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models that use sig nificant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Our financial instruments th at are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the table below.

The settlement resulted in a gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $ 240 million, which was recorded to other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of income . The estimated fair values of the contractual obligations in the table below are primarily based on certain expected future discounted cash flows, the determination of which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs. The contractual obligations involve financial interests held by a third party in certain NBCUniversal businesses and are based on a percentage of future revenue of the specified businesses. The most significant unobservable inputs we use include our estimates of the future revenue we expect to generate from cer tain NBCUniversal businesses . The discount rates used in the measurements of fair value as of September 30, 2015 were between 12 % and 13 % and are based on the underlying risk associated with our estimate of future revenue and the terms of the respective contracts . The fair value adjustments to the contractual obligations are sensitive to the assumptions related to future revenue, as well as to current interest rates, and therefore the adjustments are recorded to oth er income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of income .

Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial instruments and their clas sification within the fair value hierarchy. Our financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis were not material for all periods presented, except for the liabilities associated with our contractual obligations. The estimat ed fair values of the contractual obligations in the table below are primarily based on certain expected future discounted cash flows, the determination of which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs. The contractual obligations involve finan cial interests held by a third party in certain of our businesses and are based on a percentage of future revenue of the specified businesses. The most significant unobservable inputs we use include our estimates of the future revenue we expect to generate from certain of our businesses. The d iscount rates used in the measurements of fair value as of September 30, 2015 were between 12 % and 13 % and are based on the underlying risk associated with our estimate of future revenue and the terms of the respective cont ract s .

This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortiz ation expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation pr ograms.

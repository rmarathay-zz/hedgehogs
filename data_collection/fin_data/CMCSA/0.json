                "value": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated accounting guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. We have substantially completed the review of our revenue arrangements and do not currently expect that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we do expect that the new standard will impact the timing of recognition for (1) our Cable Communications segment\u2019s installation revenue and commission expenses, which will be recognized as revenue and costs over a period of time instead of immediately, and (2) our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments\u2019 content licensing revenue associated with renewals or extensions of existing program licensing agreements, which will be recognized as revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension instead of when the agreement is renewed or extended. In addition, upon adoption, we anticipate implementing certain changes in the presentation of revenue and expenses, including changes related to the allocation of revenue among the cable services included in a bundle that our residential customers purchase at a discount. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of our revenue transactions. We intend to adopt the provisions of the guidance using the full retrospective method, under which we will adjust any prior periods presented to reflect the updated guidance. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance requires a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. If we had adopted the provisions of the updated guidance as of January 1, 2017 for our equity investments classified as available-for-sale securities, primarily our investment in Snap Inc. (see Note 6), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation would have decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2017 by $88 million and increased for the six months ended June 30, 2017 by $16 million . We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our cost method investments. Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases. The asset and liability are initially measured based on the present value of committed lease payments. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance. For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from previous guidance. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation In March 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance that affects several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The most significant change for us relates to the presentation of the income and withholding tax consequences of share-based compensation in our consolidated financial statements. Among the changes, the updated guidance requires that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also states that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flows and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they were under the prior guidance. In addition, the updated guidance requires that, when an employer withholds shares upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity and we include these amounts in the caption \u201crepurchases of common stock under repurchase program and employee plans\u201d in our consolidated statement of cash flows. We previously recorded these amounts as operating activities. We adopted the updated guidance as of January 1, 2017 and, as required, we prospectively adopted the provisions that relate to the recognition of the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies in our condensed consolidated statement of income. The excess tax benefits resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of $59 million and $198 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. In addition, the excess tax benefits resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders of $0.01 and $0.03 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , respectively. As required by the updated guidance, the prior year periods in our condensed consolidated statement of income were not adjusted as a result of these provisions. In addition, we retrospectively adopted the provisions of this guidance related to changes to the statement of cash flows for all periods presented. This resulted in increases to net cash provided by operating activities and decreases to net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of $543 million and $411 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.",

In the auction, NBCUniversal relinquished its spectrum rights in the New York, Philadelphia and Chicago designated market areas (\u201cDMAs\u201d) where NBC and Telemundo had overlapping spectrum. NBCUniversal received proceeds of $482 million in July 2017. NBC and Telemundo stations will share broadcast signals in these DMAs. In connection with the auction, we also acquired the rights to $1.7 billion of spectrum, which were recorded to other intangible assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2017. We had previously made a deposit of $1.8 billion to participate in the auction in the third quarter of 2016 and received a refund for amounts in excess of the purchase price in the second quarter of 2017. Universal Studios Japan On April 6, 2017, we acquired the remaining interests in Universal Studios Japan that we did not already own for $2.3 billion . The acquisition was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our commercial paper program. Because we maintained control of Universal Studios Japan, the difference between the consideration transferred and the recorded value of the noncontrolling interests, as well as the related tax and accumulated other comprehensive income impacts, were recorded to additional paid-in capital. DreamWorks Animation On August 22, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion . DreamWorks Animation \u2019 s stockholders received $41 in cash for each share of DreamWorks Animation common stock. DreamWorks Animation creates animated feature films, television series and specials, live entertainment, and related consumer products. The results of operations for DreamWorks Animation are reported in our Filmed Entertainment segment following the acquisition date. Allocation of Purchase Price The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities are to be recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date. We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities of DreamWorks Animation at their estimated fair values based on valuation analyses. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates were primarily based on Level 3 inputs, including future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions and discount rates. The fair value of the assumed debt was primarily based on quoted market values. The fair value of the liability related to a tax receivable agreement that DreamWorks Animation had previously entered into with one of its former stockholders (the \u201ctax receivable agreement\u201d) was based on the contractual settlement provisions in the agreement. Further, we recorded deferred income taxes based on our estimates of the tax basis of the acquired net assets and the valuation allowances based on the expected use of net operating loss carryforwards. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , we updated the preliminary allocation of purchase price for DreamWorks Animation, which primarily resulted in increases to noncontrolling interests, intangible assets and goodwill and decreases to working capital and deferred income tax assets. The changes did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We may adjust these amounts further as valuations are finalized and we obtain information necessary to complete the analyses, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Contingencies We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed in December 2011 by Sprint Communications Company L.P. (\u201cSprint\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. Sprint\u2019s initial complaint alleged that Comcast Digital Voice and XFINITY Voice infringe twelve Sprint patents covering various aspects of a telecommunications system. In March 2015, Sprint withdrew its allegations of infringement for two of the patents. In December 2016, the Court granted summary judgment for us with respect to non-infringement on one of the patents and granted summary judgment for Sprint on one of the patents as to infringement with respect to some but not all of our accused telecommunications systems but not as to the patent\u2019s validity. In January 2017, the Court entered judgment in favor of us on Sprint\u2019s claims for infringement of two of the patents. In March 2017, Sprint indicated that it would not proceed to trial on three of the patents. Trial with respect to the four remaining patents, including the patent for which the Court granted partial summary judgment to Sprint, is set to begin in late October 2017. Sprint seeks approximately $950 million in damages, plus pre-judgment interest. In July 2017, Sprint filed a motion to amend the pre-trial order seeking to add an allegation that we willfully infringed Sprint\u2019s patents and should be subject to increased damages, which could as much as triple the amount of any damages awarded. In July 2017, Sprint also filed a motion for partial summary judgment of certain of our defenses. We believe the claims in the Sprint lawsuit are without merit and are defending the action vigorously. We cannot predict the outcome of the Sprint lawsuit, estimate a range of possible loss or determine how the final resolution of the action would affect our results of operations or cash flows for any one period or our consolidated financial position. In addition, as any action nears a trial, there is an increased possibility that the action may be settled by the parties. Nevertheless, we do not expect the final disposition of the Sprint lawsuit to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but it could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period. We also are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. In certain of these cases, other industry participants are also defendants, and also in certain of these cases, we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment and technology vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions, including the Sprint lawsuit above. In addition, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.",

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , 2.8% of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees. (b) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (c) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following: \u2022 our Cable Networks segment generates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount \u2022 our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with our Cable Communications segment \u2022 our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment \u2022 our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue from the licensing of film and television content to our Cable Networks segment (d) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, the costs of other business initiatives, including our new wireless phone service, and the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and operates arena management-related businesses. (e) No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period. (f) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, other income (expense) items, net, and depreciation and amortization, and excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets, if any. Other income (expense) items, net include interest expense, investment income (loss), equity in net income (losses) of investees, and other income (expense), net (as stated in our condensed consolidated statement of income). This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

                "value": "Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated accounting guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. We have substantially completed the review of our revenue arrangements and do not currently expect that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we do expect that the new standard will impact the timing of recognition for (1) our Cable Communications segment\u2019s installation revenue and commission expenses, which will be recognized as revenue and costs over a period of time instead of immediately, and (2) our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments\u2019 content licensing revenue associated with renewals or extensions of existing program licensing agreements, which will be recognized as revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension instead of when the agreement is renewed or extended. In addition, upon adoption, we anticipate implementing certain changes in the presentation of revenue and expenses, including changes related to the allocation of revenue among the cable services included in a bundle that our residential customers purchase at a discount. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of our revenue transactions. We intend to adopt the provisions of the guidance using the full retrospective method, under which we will adjust any prior periods presented to reflect the updated guidance. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance requires a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. If we had adopted the provisions of the updated guidance as of January 1, 2017 for our equity investments classified as available-for-sale securities, primarily our investment in Snap Inc. (see Note 6), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation would have decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2017 by $88 million and increased for the six months ended June 30, 2017 by $16 million . We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our cost method investments. Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases. The asset and liability are initially measured based on the present value of committed lease payments. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance. For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from previous guidance. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation In March 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance that affects several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The most significant change for us relates to the presentation of the income and withholding tax consequences of share-based compensation in our consolidated financial statements. Among the changes, the updated guidance requires that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income rather than as additional paid-in capital in the balance sheet. The guidance also states that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the statement of cash flows and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they were under the prior guidance. In addition, the updated guidance requires that, when an employer withholds shares upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity and we include these amounts in the caption \u201crepurchases of common stock under repurchase program and employee plans\u201d in our consolidated statement of cash flows. We previously recorded these amounts as operating activities. We adopted the updated guidance as of January 1, 2017 and, as required, we prospectively adopted the provisions that relate to the recognition of the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies in our condensed consolidated statement of income. The excess tax benefits resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of $59 million and $198 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. In addition, the excess tax benefits resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders of $0.01 and $0.03 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , respectively. As required by the updated guidance, the prior year periods in our condensed consolidated statement of income were not adjusted as a result of these provisions. In addition, we retrospectively adopted the provisions of this guidance related to changes to the statement of cash flows for all periods presented. This resulted in increases to net cash provided by operating activities and decreases to net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of $543 million and $411 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.",

                "value": "Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should recognize revenue and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. The updated accounting guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. We have substantially completed the review of our revenue arrangements and do not currently expect that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we do expect that the new standard will impact the timing of recognition for our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments\u2019 content licensing revenue associated with renewals or extensions of existing program licensing agreements, which will be recognized as revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension instead of when the agreement is renewed or extended. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of our revenue transactions. We intend to adopt the provisions of the guidance using the full retrospective method, under which we will adjust any prior periods presented to reflect the updated guidance. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated accounting guidance, among other things, requires that all nonconsolidated equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method, be measured at fair value and that the changes in fair value be recognized in net income. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2018. The updated accounting guidance requires a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year the guidance is adopted with certain exceptions. If we had adopted the provisions of the updated guidance as of January 1, 2017 for our equity investments classified as available-for-sale securities, primarily our investment in Snap Inc. (see Note 6), net income attributable to NBCUniversal would have decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 by $140 million and $139 million , respectively. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our cost method investments. Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases. The asset and liability are initially measured based on the present value of committed lease payments. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease do not significantly change from previous guidance. For a lessor, the accounting applied is also largely unchanged from previous guidance. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The updated accounting guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. ",

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , 2.8% of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees. (b) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (c) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following: \u2022 our Cable Networks segment generates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount \u2022 our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with our Cable Communications segment \u2022 our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment \u2022 our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue from the licensing of film and television content to our Cable Networks segment (d) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, the costs of other business initiatives, including our new wireless phone service, and the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and operates arena management-related businesses. (e) No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period. (f) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, other income (expense) items, net, and depreciation and amortization, and excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets, if any. Other income (expense) items, net include interest expense, investment income (loss), equity in net income (losses) of investees, and other income (expense), net (as stated in our condensed consolidated statement of income). This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

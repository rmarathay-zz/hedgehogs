For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , 2.8 % of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees. NBCUniversal Headquarte rs and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following:\n\u2022 our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount\n\u2022 our Cable Co mmunications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment\n\u2022 our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks s egment\n\u2022 our Cable Communications segment receives incentives offered by our Cable Networks segment in connection with its distribution of the Cable Networks\u2019 content that are recorded as a reduction to programming expenses No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period. We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of pr ofit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in bus iness combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources a nd capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance wit h that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.",

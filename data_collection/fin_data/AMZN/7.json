                "value": "ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unaudited Interim Financial Information We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated balance sheets, operating results, and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2015 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows and recasting the segment financial information within \u201cNote 4 \u2014 Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets\u201d and \u201cNote 8 \u2014 Segment Information\u201d as a result of changing our reportable segments to include an Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) segment. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation and impairment of investments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collectability of receivables, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, depreciable lives of property and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equity interests, and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. In Q2 2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014, we excluded stock awards of 8 million . The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 2015 2014 2015 2014 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 467 461 466 460 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 9 \u2014 9 \u2014 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 476 461 475 460",

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 \u2014Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 \u2014Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 \u2014Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of June 30, 2015 , or December 31, 2014 .

The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon\u2019s Elastic Compute Cloud infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,200,746, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Territory-Based Processing Of Information,\u201d and 8,341,209, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Processing Information Via Networked Computers Including Request Handlers, Process Handlers, And Task Handlers.\u201d The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of monetary damages, treble damages, costs, and interest. In March 2015, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In July 2015, the court granted our motion for judgment on the pleadings and invalidated the patents-in-suit. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2013, ContentGuard Holdings, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain digital rights management software used by various Kindle Fire software applications, including the Kindle Reader and Amazon Instant Video, infringe seven U.S. Patents: Nos. 6,963,859, entitled \u201cContent Rendering Repository\u201d; 7,523,072, entitled \u201cSystem For Controlling The Distribution And Use Of Digital Works\u201d; 7,269,576, entitled \u201cContent Rendering Apparatus\u201d; 8,370,956, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Rendering Digital Content In Accordance With Usage Rights Information\u201d; 8,393,007, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Distributing Digital Content In Accordance With Usage Rights Information\u201d; 7,225,160, entitled \u201cDigital Works Having Usage Rights And Method For Creating The Same\u201d; and 8,583,556, entitled \u201cMethod For Providing A Digital Asset For Distribution.\u201d In January 2014, ContentGuard filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added HTC Corporation and HTC America as defendants. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, an injunction, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. In May 2015, ContentGuard\u2019s damages expert opined that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to up to $230 million in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In March 2014, Kaavo, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Web Services\u2019 Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation infringe U.S. Patent No. 8,271,974, entitled \u201cCloud Computing Lifecycle Management For N-Tier Applications.\u201d The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of monetary damages, costs, and interest. In June 2015, the case was stayed pending resolution of a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a related case. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2014, Smartflash LLC and Smartflash Technologies Limited filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, AMZN Mobile, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc. and Audible, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Appstore, Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Music, Audible Audiobooks, the Amazon Mobile Ad Network, certain Kindle and Fire devices, Kindle e-bookstore, Amazon\u2019s proprietary Android operating system, and the servers involved in operating Amazon Appstore, Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Music, the Fire TV app, Audible Audiobooks, Cloud Drive, Cloud Player, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Mobile Ad Network infringe seven related U.S. Patents: Nos. 7,334,720; 7,942,317; 8,033,458; 8,061,598; 8,118,221; 8,336,772; and 8,794,516, all entitled \u201cData Storage and Access Systems.\u201d In May 2015, the case was stayed until further notice. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, an injunction, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In June 2015, the European Commission opened a proceeding against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon EU S.\u00e0.r.l. to investigate whether provisions in Amazon\u2019s contracts with European publishers violate European competition rules. We believe we comply with European competition rules and are cooperating with the Commission. The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.

The primary reasons for these acquisitions, none of which was individually material to our consolidated financial statements, were to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition activity for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was not material. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and not significant. The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was allocated as follows (in millions): Purchase Price Cash paid, net of cash acquired $ 303 Indemnification holdback 46 $ 349 Allocation Goodwill $ 218 Intangible assets (1): Contract-based 1 Technology-based 155 Customer-related 4 160 Property and equipment 1 Deferred tax assets 27 Other assets acquired 20 Deferred tax liabilities (54 ) Other liabilities assumed (23 ) $ 349 ___________________ (1) Acquired intangible assets have estimated useful lives of between one and six years, with a weighted-average amortization period of five years. We determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach. These assets are included within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line over their estimated useful lives. Pro Forma Financial Information (unaudited) The acquired companies were consolidated into our financial statements starting on their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate net sales and operating loss of the companies acquired was $7 million and $29 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 . The following financial information, which excludes certain acquired companies for which the pro forma impact is not meaningful, presents our results as if the current year acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of 2014 (in millions): Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 Net sales $ 45,904 $ 39,082 Net income (loss) $ 32 $ (45 ) Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes and is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2015 by segment (in millions): North America International AWS Consolidated Goodwill - January 1, 2015 $ 1,978 $ 735 $ 606 $ 3,319 New acquisitions 41 17 160 218 Other adjustments (1) (2 ) (15 ) 3 (14 ) Goodwill - June 30, 2015 $ 2,017 $ 737 $ 769 $ 3,523 ___________________ (1) Primarily includes changes in foreign exchange rates. During the second quarter of 2015, we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in the delay, acceleration, or avoidance of an impairment charge. We believe this timing better aligns the goodwill impairment test with our strategic business planning process, which is a key component of the goodwill impairment test. We have completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2015 and have determined that goodwill is not impaired.",

Interest on the Notes issued in 2014 is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December . Interest on the Notes issued in 2012 is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November . We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the Notes are used for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $9.0 billion and $9.1 billion as of June 30, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , which is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of those dates. The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted average interest rate of 4.3% and 5.5% as of June 30, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 . We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain international operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of June 30, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 . On September 5, 2014 , we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders that provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion . The Credit Agreement has a term of two years , but it may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders . The initial interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the London interbank offered rate (\u201c LIBOR \u201d) plus 0.625% , under our current credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded this rate could increase to as much as LIBOR plus 1.00% . There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2015 .",

            "Income Taxes": {
                "value": "INCOME TAXES Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In 2015 , our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Our effective tax rate may also be adversely impacted by the amount of our pretax income, or loss, relative to our income tax expense, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development credit at the end of 2014. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $337 million , which included $41 million of discrete tax items primarily attributed to acquisition integrations. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $167 million , which included $91 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $65 million and $71 million in Q2 2015 and Q2 2014 , and $119 million and $109 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 . As of June 30, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , tax contingencies were $854 million and $710 million . We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2015 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019 tax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter . These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. To date, we have not resolved this matter administratively and are currently contesting it in U.S. Tax Court. We continue to disagree with these IRS positions and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (\u201cFTA\u201d) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter . These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes. In September 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions. In June 2015, we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French tax of \u20ac196 million , including interest and penalties through September 2012. We disagree with the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously. We plan to pursue all available administrative remedies at the FTA, and if we are not able to resolve this matter with the FTA, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2006 through 2010, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments in respect of these particular jurisdictions for 2003 and thereafter.",

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses \u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cMarketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. We exclude from our allocations the portions of these operating expense lines attributable to stock-based compensation. We do not allocate the line item \u201cOther operating expense (income), net\u201d to our segment operating results. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. North America The North America segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused websites such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca, and www.amazon.com.mx. This segment includes export sales from these websites. International The International segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused websites. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused websites (including export sales from these sites to customers in the U.S. and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North American websites.

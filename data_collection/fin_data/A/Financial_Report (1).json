                "value": "1. OVERVIEW, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Overview. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Our fiscal year-end is October 31, and our fiscal quarters end on January 31, April 30 and July 31. Unless otherwise stated, these dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal quarters. Basis of Presentation . We have prepared the accompanying financial data for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The October 31, 2016 condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all the disclosures required in audited financial statements by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying financial data and information should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 . In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2016 , condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 , condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 , and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 . Use of Estimates. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. Retirement of Treasury Shares. Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares. Variable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We have determined that as of April 30, 2017 there were no VIE’s required to be consolidated in the company’s consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIE’s that we have invested in nor are we the primary beneficiary. We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. As of April 30, 2017 , the carrying value of our cost method investment in a VIE was $80 million with a maximum exposure of $80 million . The investments are included on the long-term investments line of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of April 30, 2017 . The fair value of our long-term debt, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy, exceeds the carrying value by approximately $168 million and $104 million as of April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2016 , respectively. The change in the excess of fair value over carrying value in the six months ended April 30, 2017 is due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The carrying value as of October 31, 2016 reflects the new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs which we adopted on November 1, 2016. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 8, \"Fair Value Measurements\" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.",

            "NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS": {
                "value": " 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There were no changes to the new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 except for the following: In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued amendments to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs remain unchanged. The amendments were effective for us beginning November 1, 2016. The impact of adoption to our condensed consolidated balance sheet was a decrease of $8 million in other assets and long-term debt. The October 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been revised to reflect the new disclosure requirement. In May 2014, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition, Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of the amendments was to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The amendments are effective for us beginning fiscal 2019. The company expects to adopt this guidance on November 1, 2018 and will apply the modified retrospective method. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business in connection with business combinations with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. This guidance also specifies that only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance to our consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.",

            "SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION": {
                "value": "3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Agilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the long-term performance plan (“LTPP”) based on estimated fair values. Participants in the LTPP are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met. The performance target for grants made in 2016 and 2017 were based on Operating Margin (“OM”) and Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\"), respectively. The performance targets for the LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum award value cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 30, April 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 3 $ 3 $ 9 $ 9 Research and development 1 1 3 3 Selling, general and administrative 11 10 24 25 Total share-based compensation expense $ 15 $ 14 $ 36 $ 37 At April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2016 , there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 30, April 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 LTPP: Volatility of Agilent shares 23% 24% 23 % 24 % Volatility of selected peer-company shares 15%-63% 14%-50% 15%-63% 14%-50% Price-wise correlation with selected peers 36% 35% 36 % 35 % Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards 5.3% 5.5% 5.3% 5.5% Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulations model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the volatility of our 2015 and 2016 LTPP (TSR) grants, we used the 3 -year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For the volatility of our 2017 LTPP (TSR) grants, we used our own historical stock price volatility. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the price at purchase and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units, LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) awards is determined based on the market price of Agilent’s common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. All awards granted in 2017 and 2016 to our senior management employees have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model (see table above). The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. The model used the same historical stock price volatility and dividend yield assumption used for the Monte Carlo simulations model and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount.",

The company’s effective tax rate was 22.2 percent and 18.1 percent for the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 , respectively. The income tax expense was $27 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , respectively. The income tax expense was $26 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 , respectively. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 included net discrete tax benefits of $1 million and $3 million , respectively. The net discrete tax benefit for the three months ended April 30, 2017 included $5 million of tax benefit related to return-to-provision adjustments in foreign jurisdictions and $4 million of tax expense related to changes in the realization of the deferred tax assets for unremitted foreign earnings. In addition to the aforementioned, the net discrete tax benefit for the six months ended April 30, 2017 included $7 million of tax benefit for the settlement of an audit in Italy, $11 million of tax expense related to the employee pension settlement gain and $6 million of other discrete tax benefit items. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $3 million and tax benefit of $3 million , respectively. The net discrete tax expense for the three months ended April 30, 2016 included a tax expense of $7 million for return-to-provision adjustments associated with the filing of the return in Germany, $5 million of which was determined to be out of period. The remaining discrete items in the quarter included an $8 million tax benefit related to the realization of tax credits that reduce the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings, $2 million tax expense of other miscellaneous return-to-provision adjustments in other foreign jurisdictions and $2 million of miscellaneous other discrete tax expense. In addition to the aforementioned, the net discrete tax benefit for the six months ended April 30, 2016 included $5 million of tax benefit for the extension, which occurred in the first quarter of 2016, of the U.S. research and development tax credit attributable to the company's prior fiscal year, and $6 million of tax expense related to the curtailment gain recognized with respect to the U.S. retirement plan and Supplemental Benefits Plan. The net discrete tax benefit for the six months ended April 30, 2016 also included $9 million of tax benefit related primarily to return-to-provision adjustments in Singapore and $2 million of other discrete tax expense items. In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes from our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the status of these open tax years in the first six months of fiscal 2017. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. During the first quarter of 2017, the company settled its ongoing tax audit in Italy for the years 2011-2013 resulting in a net tax expense of $7 million . The settlement resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $14 million . With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. The IRS is appealing the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax Court decision in June 2016. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits or obligations, and the risk of the Tax Court’s decision being overturned upon appeal, we concluded that no adjustment to our condensed consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time.",

Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , no options to purchase shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as compared to 2.1 million and 1.7 million options to purchase shares excluded for the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 . In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.

The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets of this acquisition was finalized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and as a result we adjusted goodwill and other intangible assets by an immaterial amount. We recorded additions to goodwill of $51 million and additions to other intangible assets of $26 million during the six months ended April 30, 2017 . During the six months ended April 30, 2017 , we also wrote-off the gross carrying amount of $131 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets. During the six months ended April 30, 2017, other intangible assets, net increased $1 million due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is indicated. There were no indicators of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. There were no indicators of impairment of goodwill during the six months ended April 30, 2017 . Amortization expense of intangible assets was $31 million and $62 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , respectively.

            "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS": {
                "value": "8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Fair Value Hierarchy The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 30, 2017 were as follows: Fair Value Measurement at April 30, 2017 Using April 30, Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (in millions) Assets: Short-term Cash equivalents (money market funds) $ 1,457 $ 1,457 $ — $ — Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 6 — 6 — Long-term Trading securities 30 30 — — Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,493 $ 1,487 $ 6 $ — Liabilities: Short-term Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 4 $ — $ 4 $ — Long-term Deferred compensation liability 30 — 30 — Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 34 $ — $ 34 $ — Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2016 were as follows: Fair Value Measurement at October 31, 2016 Using October 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (in millions) Assets: Short-term Cash equivalents (money market funds) $ 1,482 $ 1,482 $ — $ — Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 9 — 9 — Long-term Trading securities 31 31 — — Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,522 $ 1,513 $ 9 $ — Liabilities: Short-term Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 8 $ — $ 8 $ — Long-term Deferred compensation liability 31 — 31 — Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 39 $ — $ 39 $ — Our money market funds and trading securities investments are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because, although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income. Impairment of Investments. There were no impairments of investments for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis For the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 , there were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used. For the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 , there were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale.",

                "value": "9. DERIVATIVES We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. As of April 30, 2017 , all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million . On October 20, 2014, we prepaid $500 million out of $600 million principal of our 2017 senior notes and fully amortized the associated proportionate deferred gain to other income (expense). The remaining gain to be amortized related to the $100 million of 2017 senior notes at April 30, 2017 was not significant. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million . The remaining gain to be amortized at April 30, 2017 was $13 million . All deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective senior notes. Cash Flow Hedges We enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. Changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) each period. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income (expense) in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) over the life of the option contract. Ineffectiveness in the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 was not significant. For the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 gains and losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012. We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at April 30, 2017 was $2 million . In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at April 30, 2017 was $9 million . Other Hedges Additionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities. Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of April 30, 2017 , was $1 million . The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of April 30, 2017 . There were 43 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of April 30, 2017 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 146 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of April 30, 2017 not designated as hedging instruments. The aggregated notional amounts by currency and designation as of April 30, 2017 were as follows: Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Forward Contracts USD Forward Contracts USD Currency Buy/(Sell) Buy/(Sell) (in millions) Euro $ (2 ) $ 124 British Pound (41 ) 25 Canadian Dollar (28 ) 9 Australian Dollar 4 11 Malaysian Ringgit — (2 ) Japanese Yen (47 ) — Other 10 35 Totals $ (104 ) $ 202 Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet in accordance with the authoritative guidance.

We contributed $6 million and $9 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , respectively. We made no contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plans during the three months ended April 30, 2016 . We contributed $9 million and $13 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 , respectively. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. defined benefit plans during the remainder of 2017 and we expect to contribute $12 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during the remainder of 2017 . In Japan, Agilent has defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). The plans were composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company. During the six months ended April 30, 2017 , Agilent received government approval and returned the substitutional portion of Japan's pension plan to the Japanese government, as allowed by the JWPIL. The transfer resulted in a net gain of $32 million recorded within cost of sales and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The net gain consisted of two parts - a gain of $41 million , representing the difference between the fair values of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) settled of $65 million and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of $24 million , offset by a settlement loss of $9 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Plan Amendments. During the three months ended January 31, 2016, we made changes to our U.S. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (\"U.S. Plans\"). Effective April 30, 2016, benefit accruals under the U.S. Plans were frozen. Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there were no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016. In addition, active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service - as of April 30, 2016 - will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement. Due to these plan amendments, we recorded a curtailment gain of $15 million in the U.S. Plans during the six months ended April 30, 2016 . In addition, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million related to the U.S. Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan during the six months ended April 30, 2016 .",

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Stock Repurchase Program On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, upon the conclusion of the company's previous $1 billion repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. During the six months ended April 30, 2016 , we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $98 million , which completed the purchases under this authorization. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the \"2015 repurchase program\"). The 2015 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $83 million and 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 , we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $94 million and 5.1 million shares for $196 million under this authorization. As of April 30, 2017 , we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $610 million of our common stock under this program. During the six months ended April 30, 2017 , we retired 294.2 million treasury shares at an aggregate cost of $10.7 billion , which represents all our previously repurchased shares over the past 11 years and our repurchases made in the first six months of fiscal year 2017. The retirement of our treasury shares resulted in a decrease of $6.7 billion to retained earnings and a decrease of $4.0 billion to additional paid-in-capital. Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock During the three and six months ended April 30, 2017 , we paid cash dividends of $0.132 per common share or $43 million and $0.264 per common share or $85 million on the company's common stock, respectively. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2016 , we paid cash dividends of $0.115 per common share or $37 million and $0.230 per common share or $75 million on the company's common stock, respectively. On May 17, 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.132 per share of common stock, or approximately $42 million which will be paid on July 26, 2017 to all shareholders of record at close of business on July 3, 2017 .

                "value": "15. SEGMENT INFORMATION Description of segments. We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments. A description of our three reportable segments is as follows: Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (\"LC\") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (\"LCMS\") systems; gas chromatography (\"GC\") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\"GCMS\") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") instruments; atomic absorption (\"AA\") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (\"ICP-OES\") instruments; cell analysis plate based assays; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies. Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of five areas of activity providing solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (\"NGS\") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") conditions for use as active pharmaceutical ingredients (\"API\") in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Next, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings to cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Finally, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes. The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab. Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies. Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity. Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, pension curtailment or settlement gains, restructuring and transformational expenses, acquisition and integration costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments. The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 30, April 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions) Net Revenue: Life Sciences and Applied Markets $ 523 $ 495 $ 1,063 $ 1,021 Diagnostics and Genomics 201 178 365 336 Agilent CrossLab 378 346 741 690 Total net revenue $ 1,102 $ 1,019 $ 2,169 $ 2,047 Segment Income From Operations: Life Sciences and Applied Markets $ 110 $ 94 $ 236 $ 208 Diagnostics and Genomics 49 27 72 42 Agilent CrossLab 82 74 156 150 Total segment income from operations $ 241 $ 195 $ 464 $ 400 The following table reconciles reportable segments’ income from operations to Agilent’s total enterprise income before taxes: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 30, April 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions) Total reportable segments’ income from operations $ 241 $ 195 $ 464 $ 400 Transformational initiatives — (10 ) (2 ) (21 ) Amortization of intangibles (31 ) (40 ) (62 ) (83 ) Acquisition and integration costs (7 ) (12 ) (21 ) (17 ) Business exit and divestiture costs (primarily our NMR business) — (1 ) — (6 ) Pension settlement gain — — 32 1 Pension curtailment gain — — — 15 Other (2 ) (1 ) (4 ) (3 ) Interest income 5 3 9 5 Interest expense (20 ) (18 ) (40 ) (36 ) Other income (expense), net 5 1 8 4 Income before taxes, as reported $ 191 $ 117 $ 384 $ 259 The following table reflects segment assets under our management reporting system.

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.",

We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We have determined that as of April 30, 2017 there were no VIE’s required to be consolidated in the company’s consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIE’s that we have invested in nor are we the primary beneficiary. We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. As of April 30, 2017 , the carrying value of our cost method investment in a VIE was $80 million with a maximum exposure of $80 million . The investments are included on the long-term investments line of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. ",

            "Fair Value of Financial Instruments": {
                "value": "Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of April 30, 2017 . The fair value of our long-term debt, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy, exceeds the carrying value by approximately $168 million and $104 million as of April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2016 , respectively. The change in the excess of fair value over carrying value in the six months ended April 30, 2017 is due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The carrying value as of October 31, 2016 reflects the new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs which we adopted on November 1, 2016. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 8, \"Fair Value Measurements\" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.",

            "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": {
                "value": "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements of Netflix, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on January 29, 2015. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming content library amortization policy; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The majority of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company\u2019s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company\u2019s revenues are derived from monthly membership fees. There have been no material changes in the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Prior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional currency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in several significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for the period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment included in other comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015. On July 14, 2015, the Company completed a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this seven-for-one stock split. The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were not affected by the stock split and accordingly have not been adjusted. See Notes 2 and 6 for additional information. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, at which time the Company will reclassify approximately $30 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt. A reclassification will also be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract. It is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment may be adopted either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. The Company has elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and will apply the guidance prospectively to all future arrangements. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of the ASU to be material to its consolidated financial statements.",

                "value": "Earnings Per Share In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to all shareholders of record as of July 2, 2015 (\"Stock Split\"). Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed as of June 30, 2015 and for all other comparative periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share, as adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split, are as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, (in thousands, except per share data) Basic earnings per share: Net income $ 26,335 $ 71,018 $ 50,031 $ 124,133 Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 425,340 419,974 424,486 419,349 Basic earnings per share $ 0.06 $ 0.17 $ 0.12 $ 0.30 Diluted earnings per share: Net income $ 26,335 $ 71,018 $ 50,031 $ 124,133 Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 425,340 419,974 424,486 419,349 Employee stock options 10,757 11,467 10,472 11,792 Weighted-average number of shares 436,097 431,441 434,958 431,141 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.06 $ 0.16 $ 0.12 $ 0.29 Employee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize, by major security type, the Company\u2019s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy and where they are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets: As of June 30, 2015 Amortized Gross Gross Estimated (in thousands) Cash $ 2,193,203 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 2,193,203 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 105,603 \u2014 \u2014 105,603 Level 2 securities: Corporate debt securities 271,569 419 (130 ) 271,858 Government securities 197,919 364 (7 ) 198,276 Certificate of deposits and commercial paper 6,100 \u2014 \u2014 6,100 Agency securities 26,621 31 \u2014 26,652 Total $ 2,801,015 $ 814 $ (137 ) $ 2,801,692 As of December 31, 2014 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value (in thousands) Cash $ 1,007,543 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 1,007,543 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 111,759 \u2014 \u2014 111,759 Level 2 securities: Corporate debt securities 295,500 432 (199 ) 295,733 Government securities 168,749 120 (95 ) 168,774 Asset and mortgage-backed securities 112 \u2014 \u2014 112 Certificate of deposits 3,600 \u2014 \u2014 3,600 Agency securities 26,665 5 (1 ) 26,669 Total $ 1,613,928 $ 557 $ (295 ) $ 1,614,190 As of June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,293,872 $ 1,113,608 Short-term investments 502,886 494,888 Other non-current assets (1) 4,934 5,694 Total $ 2,801,692 $ 1,614,190 (1) Primarily restricted cash that is related to workers compensation deposits. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company\u2019s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company's procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments. There were no investments in a material unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2015 or December 31, 2014. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in the three or six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 . In addition, there were no material gross realized gains or losses in the three or six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 .

This amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting held on June 9, 2015. On June 23, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to all shareholders of record as of July 2, 2015. Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed as of June 30, 2015 and for all other comparative periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Stock Option Plan In June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. As of June 30, 2015 , 18.1 million shares, as adjusted for the Stock Split, were reserved for future grants under the 2011 Stock Plan. A summary of the activities related to the Company\u2019s stock option plans, as adjusted for the Stock Split, is as follows: Options Outstanding Shares Number of Weighted- Weighted-Average Remaining Aggregate Balances as of December 31, 2014 20,025,208 22,845,417 $ 21.65 Granted (1,916,299 ) 1,916,299 66.07 Exercised (3,093,944 ) 11.01 Balances as of June 30, 2015 18,108,909 21,667,772 $ 27.09 6.40 $ 1,446,423 Vested and exercisable as of June 30, 2015 21,667,772 $ 27.09 6.40 $ 1,446,423 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company\u2019s closing stock price on the last trading day of the second quarter of 2015 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of the second quarter of 2015 . This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock. A summary of the amounts related to option exercises, is as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, (in thousands) Total intrinsic value of options exercised $ 114,783 $ 46,179 $ 195,621 $ 147,720 Cash received from options exercised $ 23,804 $ 14,469 $ 34,720 $ 46,917 Stock-based Compensation The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value stock option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data, as adjusted for the Stock Split: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, Dividend yield \u2014 % \u2014 % \u2014 % \u2014 % Expected volatility 36 % 45 % 36 % 45% - 48% Risk-free interest rate 2.05 % 2.66 % 2.03% - 2.05% 2.66% - 2.83% Suboptimal exercise factor 2.47 2.66 - 4.20 2.47 -2.48 2.66 - 4.20 Valuation data: Weighted-average fair value (per share) $ 32.52 $ 28.13 $ 29.24 $ 29.69 Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) $ 28,590 $ 29,285 $ 56,031 $ 55,110 Total income tax benefit related to stock options (in thousands) $ 10,796 $ 11,225 $ 21,188 $ 21,124 The Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior and the employee groupings. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company's computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade volume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock. In valuing shares issued under the Company\u2019s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.",

The effective tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were 37% and 40% , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, foreign taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by the California R&D credit. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to lower tax reserves on uncertain tax positions following an IRS Appeals settlement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross unrecognized tax benefits were $38.1 million and $34.8 million as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized by the Company, will result in a reduction of approximately $31.5 million to the provision for income taxes thereby favorably impacting the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits are classified as \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the \"Provision for income taxes\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2015 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $0.4 million , and is classified as \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred tax assets include $15.8 million and $13.4 million classified as \u201cOther current assets\u201d and $145.7 million and $106.9 million classified as \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , respectively. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , it was considered more likely than not that all deferred tax assets would be realized. Income tax benefits attributable to the exercise of employee stock options of $39.1 million and $14.6 million , during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Income tax benefits attributable to the exercise of employee stock options of $67.9 million and $47.1 million , during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These benefits were recorded directly to \"Additional paid-in capital\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company files U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2010 through 2013. The Company is also currently under examination by the state of California for the years 2006 and 2007. California has completed its Field Exam of the 2006 and 2007 California tax returns and has issued a Notice of Proposed Assessment primarily related to the Company's R&D Credits claimed in those years. The Company has filed a protest against the proposed assessment and is currently in the midst of the Franchise Tax Board Protest process. The years 1997 through 2005, as well as 2008 through 2013 remain subject to examination by the state of California. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions. Given the potential outcome of the current examinations, as well as the impact of the current examination on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, at this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.",

Once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments could range from less than one year to more than five years. The Company has entered into certain licenses with performing rights organizations (\"PROs\"), and is currently involved in negotiations with other PROs, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works \"publicly performed\" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any change in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates. Legal Proceedings From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. On January 13, 2012, the first of three purported shareholder class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Two additional purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the same court on January 27, 2012 and February 29, 2012 alleging substantially similar claims. These lawsuits were consolidated into In re Netflix, Inc., Securities Litigation , Case No. 3:12-cv-00225-SC, and the Court selected lead plaintiffs. On June 26, 2012, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint which alleged violations of the federal securities laws. The Court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend on February 13, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint on March 22, 2013. The Court dismissed the first amended consolidated complaint with prejudice on August 20, 2013, and judgment was entered on September 27, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and requested leave to file a second amended complaint on October 25, 2013. On January 17, 2014, the Court denied that motion. On February 18, 2014, lead plaintiffs appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable On November 23, 2011, the first of six purported shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Five additional purported shareholder derivative suits were subsequently filed: two in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County on February 9, 2012 and May 2, 2012; and three in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on February 13, 2012, February 24, 2012 and April 2, 2012. The purported shareholder derivative suits filed in the Northern District of California have been voluntarily dismissed. On July 5, 2012, the purported shareholder derivative suits filed in Santa Clara County were consolidated into In re Netflix, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation , Case No. 1-12-cv-218399, and lead counsel was appointed. A consolidated complaint was filed on December 4, 2012, with plaintiffs seeking compensatory damages and other relief. The consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties, issued false and misleading statements primarily regarding the Company's streaming business, violated accounting rules concerning segment reporting, violated provisions of the California Corporations Code, and wasted corporate assets. The consolidated complaint further alleges that the defendants caused the Company to buy back stock at artificially inflated prices to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders while contemporaneously selling personally held Company stock. The Company filed a demurrer to the consolidated complaint and a motion to stay the derivative litigation in favor of the related federal securities class action on February 4, 2013. On June 21, 2013, the Court granted the motion to stay the derivative litigation pending resolution of the related federal securities class action. Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable. The Company is involved in other litigation matters not listed above but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company\u2019s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. The Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company\u2019s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.",

                "value": "Segment Information The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company\u2019s CODM reviews revenues and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses directly incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics. The Domestic and International streaming segments derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company\u2019s segments. Cost of revenues are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on the amounts directly incurred by the segment to obtain content and deliver it to the specific region. Content rights increasingly include multiple geographies as the Company aspires to obtain global content rights to support global expansion. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic segments based on estimated fair market value. Marketing expenses are primarily comprised of advertising expenses which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.

Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. The Company offers free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. For inclusion in the definition of a membership in the above metrics, a method of payment is required to be provided even during the free-trial period. Total memberships therefore include those who are on a free-trial and have provided a method of payment. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately.",

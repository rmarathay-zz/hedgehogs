                "value": "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements of Netflix, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on January 28, 2016. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming content asset amortization policy; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, all of which derive revenue from monthly membership fees. See Note 10 for further detail on the Company's segments. There have been no material changes in the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in the consolidated financial statements. The Company reclassified the change in prepaid content of $3.0 million and $31.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, from \"Other current assets\" to \"Additions to streaming content assets\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply it retrospectively. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 718, Compensation \u2013 Stock Compensation . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.",

The computation of earnings per share is as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, (in thousands, except per share data) Basic earnings per share: Net income $ 40,755 $ 26,335 $ 68,413 $ 50,031 Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 428,483 425,340 428,300 424,486 Basic earnings per share $ 0.10 $ 0.06 $ 0.16 $ 0.12 Diluted earnings per share: Net income $ 40,755 $ 26,335 $ 68,413 $ 50,031 Shares used in computation: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 428,483 425,340 428,300 424,486 Employee stock options 9,671 10,757 9,773 10,472 Weighted-average number of shares 438,154 436,097 438,073 434,958 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.09 $ 0.06 $ 0.16 $ 0.12 Employee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

                "value": "Short-term Investments The Company\u2019s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company\u2019s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and investment return. From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize, by major security type, the Company\u2019s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy and where they are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets: As of June 30, 2016 Amortized Gross Gross Estimated Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments Non-current assets (1) (in thousands) Cash $ 851,449 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 851,449 $ 848,875 $ \u2014 $ 2,574 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 543,564 \u2014 \u2014 543,564 542,050 \u2014 1,514 Level 2 securities: Corporate debt securities 200,366 1,195 (49 ) 201,512 \u2014 201,512 \u2014 Government securities 230,815 759 \u2014 231,574 \u2014 231,574 \u2014 Agency securities 10,209 8 \u2014 10,217 \u2014 10,217 \u2014 Total $ 1,836,403 $ 1,962 $ (49 ) $ 1,838,316 $ 1,390,925 $ 443,303 $ 4,088 As of December 31, 2015 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments Non-current assets (1) (in thousands) Cash $ 1,708,220 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 1,708,220 $ 1,706,592 $ \u2014 $ 1,628 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 107,199 \u2014 \u2014 107,199 102,738 \u2014 4,461 Level 2 securities: Corporate debt securities 240,867 154 (409 ) 240,612 \u2014 240,612 \u2014 Government securities 235,252 \u2014 (1,046 ) 234,206 \u2014 234,206 \u2014 Agency securities 26,576 \u2014 (9 ) 26,567 \u2014 26,567 \u2014 Total $ 2,318,114 $ 154 $ (1,464 ) $ 2,316,804 $ 1,809,330 $ 501,385 $ 6,089 (1) Primarily restricted cash that is related to workers compensation deposits and letter of credit agreements. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company\u2019s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company's procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company\u2019s senior notes. The Company does not intend to sell the investments that are in an unrealized loss position and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell any investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As such, the Company does not consider those investments with an unrealized loss to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, respectively. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In addition, there were no material gross realized gains or losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The estimated fair value of short-term investments by contractual maturity as of June 30, 2016 is as follows: (in thousands) Due within one year $ 144,035 Due after one year and through five years 299,268 Total short-term investments $ 443,303",

                "value": "Commitments and Contingencies Streaming Content As of June 30, 2016 , the Company had $13.2 billion of obligations comprised of $3.2 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.7 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $7.3 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had $10.9 billion of obligations comprised of $2.8 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.0 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $6.1 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they do not yet meet the criteria for recognition. The expected timing of payments for these streaming content obligations is as follows: As of June 30, December 31, (in thousands) Less than one year $ 5,544,875 $ 4,703,172 Due after one year and through three years 6,305,936 5,249,147 Due after three years and through five years 1,220,827 891,864 Due after five years 122,371 58,048 Total streaming content obligations $ 13,194,009 $ 10,902,231 Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. A content obligation for the production of original content includes non-cancellable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. A content obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant. Legal Proceedings From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. On January 13, 2012, the first of three purported shareholder class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Two additional purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the same court on January 27, 2012 and February 29, 2012 alleging substantially similar claims. These lawsuits were consolidated into In re Netflix, Inc., Securities Litigation , Case No. 3:12-cv-00225-SC, and the Court selected lead plaintiffs. On June 26, 2012, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint which alleged violations of the federal securities laws. The Court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend on February 13, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint on March 22, 2013. The Court dismissed the first amended consolidated complaint with prejudice on August 20, 2013, and judgment was entered on September 27, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and requested leave to file a second amended complaint on October 25, 2013. On January 17, 2014, the Court denied that motion. On February 18, 2014, lead plaintiffs appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; oral argument occurred on March 17, 2016. On April 11, 2016, the Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal of the suit with prejudice. On November 23, 2011, the first of six purported shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Five additional purported shareholder derivative suits were subsequently filed: two in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County on February 9, 2012 and May 2, 2012; and three in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on February 13, 2012, February 24, 2012 and April 2, 2012. The purported shareholder derivative suits filed in the Northern District of California have been voluntarily dismissed. On July 5, 2012, the purported shareholder derivative suits filed in Santa Clara County were consolidated into In re Netflix, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation , Case No. 1-12-cv-218399, and lead counsel was appointed. A consolidated complaint was filed on December 4, 2012, with plaintiffs seeking compensatory damages and other relief. The consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties, issued false and misleading statements primarily regarding the Company's streaming business, violated accounting rules concerning segment reporting, violated provisions of the California Corporations Code, and wasted corporate assets. The consolidated complaint further alleges that the defendants caused the Company to buy back stock at artificially inflated prices to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders while contemporaneously selling personally held Company stock. The Company filed a demurrer to the consolidated complaint and a motion to stay the derivative litigation in favor of the related federal securities class action on February 4, 2013. On June 21, 2013, the Court granted the motion to stay the derivative litigation pending resolution of the related federal securities class action. Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable. The Company is involved in other litigation matters not listed above but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company\u2019s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. The Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company\u2019s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.",

This amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting held on June 9, 2015. On June 23, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to all shareholders of record as of July 2, 2015. Stock Option Plan In June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. As of June 30, 2016 , 15.1 million shares were reserved for future grants under the 2011 Stock Plan.

This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock. A summary of the amounts related to option exercises, is as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, (in thousands) Total intrinsic value of options exercised $ 37,268 $ 114,783 $ 68,725 $ 195,621 Cash received from options exercised $ 4,232 $ 23,804 $ 7,768 $ 34,720 Stock-based Compensation The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value stock option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, Dividend yield \u2014 % \u2014 % \u2014 % \u2014 % Expected volatility 45 % 36 % 45% - 50% 36 % Risk-free interest rate 1.83 % 2.05 % 1.83% - 2.04% 2.03% - 2.05% Suboptimal exercise factor 2.48 2.47 2.48 2.47 - 2.48 Weighted-average fair value (per share) $ 48.38 $ 32.52 $ 49.52 $ 29.24 Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) $ 44,112 $ 28,590 $ 86,534 $ 56,031 Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) $ 16,571 $ 10,796 $ 32,534 $ 21,188 The Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior. The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock. In valuing shares issued under the Company\u2019s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.",

The decrease in the Company's effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross unrecognized tax benefits were $22.4 million and $17.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized by the Company, will result in a reduction of approximately $17.4 million to the provision for income taxes thereby favorably impacting the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The Company classified unrecognized tax benefits that are expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as \u201cAccrued expenses\u201d. The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \"Other non-current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the \"Provision for income taxes\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company\u2019s \u201cProvision for income taxes\u201d were not material in any of the periods presented. Deferred tax assets include $213.8 million and $180.6 million classified as \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , it was considered more likely than not that all deferred tax assets would be realized. Income tax benefits attributable to the exercise of employee stock options are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. These benefits amounted to $13.3 million and $39.1 million , during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and amounted to $24.6 million and $67.9 million , during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The 2014 Federal tax return is subject to examination by the IRS. The 2008 through 2014 state tax returns are subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2015 remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities. Given the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2016 , the Company has identified gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4.0 million in \u201cAccrued expenses\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $18.4 million cannot be made.",

                "value": "Segment Information The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company\u2019s CODM reviews revenues and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics. The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to members outside the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company\u2019s segments. The vast majority of the cost of revenues relate to content expenses, which include the amortization of streaming content assets and other costs associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content. In connection with the Company's global expansion, content acquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Content expenses for each streaming segment thus include both expenses directly incurred by the segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to device partners which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.

ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply it retrospectively. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 718, Compensation \u2013 Stock Compensation . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.

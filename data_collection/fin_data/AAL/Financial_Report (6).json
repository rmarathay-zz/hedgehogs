On the Effective Date, the Debtors consummated\ntheir reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the\ntransactions contemplated by an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as\namended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013,\nby and among AMR, Merger Sub and US Airways Group, pursuant to\nwhich Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US\nAirways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company\nfollowing the Merger.\nFrom the Petition Date through the Effective Date,\npursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and\norders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or\notherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition\nDate as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors\ngenerally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to\nenforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the\nPetition Date generally have been permanently enjoined. Any\nunresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims\nreconciliation process under the supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition\nliabilities may proceed in courts other than the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained\nrelief from the permanent injunction. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, trading in\nAMR’s common stock and certain debt securities on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) was suspended on January 5, 2012,\nand AMR’s common stock and such debt securities were delisted\nfrom the NYSE on January 30, 2012. On January 5, 2012,\nAMR’s common stock began trading under the symbol\n“AAMRQ” (CUSIP 001765106) on the OTCQB marketplace,\noperated by OTC Markets Group. Pursuant to the Plan, on the\nEffective Date (i) all existing shares of AAG’s old\ncommon stock formerly traded under the symbol “AAMRQ”\nwere canceled and (ii) the Company was authorized to issue up\nto approximately 544 million shares of common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, of AAG (AAG Common Stock) by operation of the Plan\n(excluding shares of AAG Common Stock issuable pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement). On the Effective Date, the AAG Common Stock was\nlisted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n“AAL,” and AAMRQ ceased trading on the OTCQB\nmarketplace. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, AAG issued\napproximately 53 million shares of AAG Common Stock to\nAMR’s old equity holders and certain of the Debtors’\nemployees, and issued 168 million shares of AAG Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the AAG\nSeries A Preferred Stock), which was mandatorily convertible into\nnew AAG Common Stock during the 120-day period after the Effective\nDate, to certain creditors and employees of the Debtors (including\nshares deposited in the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the\nPlan)). In accordance with the terms of the Plan, former holders of\nAMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol\n“AAMRQ”) received, for each share of AMR common stock,\nan initial distribution of approximately 0.0665 shares of the AAG\nCommon Stock as of the Effective Date. Following the Effective\nDate, former holders of AMR common stock and those deemed to be\ntreated as such in connection with the elections made pursuant to\nthe Plan have received through December 31, 2014, additional\naggregate distributions of shares of AAG Common Stock of\napproximately 0.6776 shares of AAG Common Stock for each share of\nAMR common stock previously held, and may continue to receive\nadditional distributions. As of the Effective Date, the adjusted\ntotal Double-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan)\nwere approximately $2.5 billion and the Allowed Single-Dip General\nUnsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.5\nbillion. The Disputed Claims Reserve established under the\nPlan initially was issued 30.4 million shares, which shares\nare reserved for distributions to holders of disputed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims (Single-Dip Equity Obligations) whose claims\nultimately become allowed as well as to certain AMR labor groups\nand employees who received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed\npercentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured\nclaimholders. As of December 31, 2014, the Disputed Claims\nReserve held 26.8 million shares of AAG Common Stock pending\ndistribution of those shares in accordance with the Plan. On\nFebruary 10, 2015, approximately 0.8 million shares of\nAAG Common Stock held in the Disputed Claims Reserve were\ndistributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims, to\nholders of certain labor-related deemed claims, and to holders of\ncertain non-management, non-union employee deemed claims as\nspecified in the Plan, and the Company repurchased less than\n0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock for an aggregate of $4\nmillion from the Disputed Claims Reserve at the then-prevailing\nmarket price in order to fund cash tax obligations resulting from\nthis distribution. On July 14, 2015, approximately\n0.6 million shares of AAG Common Stock held in the Disputed\nClaims Reserve were distributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims, to holders of certain labor-related deemed\nclaims, and to holders of certain non-management, non-union\nemployee deemed claims as specified in the Plan, and the Company\nrepurchased less than 0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock\nfor an aggregate of $2 million from the Disputed Claims Reserve at\nthe then-prevailing market price in order to fund cash tax\nobligations resulting from this distribution. As of\nSeptember 30, 2015, there were approximately 25.3 million\nshares of AAG Common Stock remaining in the Disputed Claims\nReserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will\nreceive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on\nthe same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about\nthe Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares\nremain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed\nclaims, such shares will not be returned to the Company but rather\nwill be distributed to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective\nDate. The Company is not required to distribute additional shares\nabove the limits contemplated by the Plan. Several parties have filed appeals seeking\nreconsideration of the Confirmation Order. See Note 13 for more\ninformation. The reconciliation process with respect to the\nremaining claims is expected to take considerable time. The\nCompany’s estimate of the amounts of disputed claims that\nwill ultimately become allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims are\nincluded in bankruptcy settlement obligations on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2015. As these claims are resolved, or where\nbetter information becomes available and is evaluated, the Company\nwill make adjustments to the liabilities recorded on its condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as appropriate. Any such\nadjustments could be material to the Company’s financial\nposition or results of operations in any given period.\nMerger Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and consistent\nwith the Plan, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per\nshare, of US Airways Group (the US Airways Group Common Stock) was\nconverted into the right to receive one share of AAG Common Stock.\nThe aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable in the\nMerger to holders of US Airways Group equity instruments (including\nstockholders, holders of convertible notes, optionees, and holders\nof restricted stock units (RSUs)) represented 28% of the diluted\nequity ownership of AAG. The remaining 72% diluted equity ownership\nin AAG (up to approximately 544 million shares) was or is\ndistributable, pursuant to the Plan, to stakeholders, labor unions,\ncertain employees of AMR and the other Debtors, and former holders\nof AMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol\n“AAMRQ”) such that the aggregate number of shares of\nAAG Common Stock issuable under the Plan will not exceed 72% of the\ndiluted equity ownership of AAG as of the time of the Merger. Availability and Utilization of Net Operating\nLosses Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Debtors\nexperienced an “ownership change” as defined in\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(Section 382), which could potentially limit the ability to utilize\ncertain tax attributes including the Debtors’ substantial net\noperating losses (NOLs). The general limitation rules for a debtor\nin a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change\noccurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. The Debtors elected to be\ncovered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes\nthat permit approximately $9.0 billion of the federal NOLs carried\nover from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to be utilized\nwithout regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by\nSection 382. Moreover, an ownership change subsequent to the\nDebtors’ emergence from bankruptcy may further limit or\neffectively eliminate the ability to utilize the Debtors’ NOL\nCarryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a\npotential adverse effect on the Debtors’ ability to utilize\nthe NOL Carryforwards, AAG’s Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation) contains transfer\nrestrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders.\nAlthough the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent\nan ownership change from occurring, there can be no assurance that\nan ownership change will not occur even with these transfer\nrestrictions. A copy of the Certificate of Incorporation was\nattached as Exhibit 3.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by\nthe Company with the SEC on December 9, 2013.",

As\nof September 30, 2015, as a result of American’s\nimproved credit ratings, the LIBOR margin was 2.75%. 2015-1 EETCs In March 2015, American created two pass-through\ntrusts which issued approximately $1.2 billion aggregate face\namount of Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2015-1\nEETCs) in connection with the financing of 28 aircraft owned by\nAmerican (the 2015 EETC Aircraft). As of September 30, 2015, the entire $1.2\nbillion of the proceeds from the sale of the 2015-1 EETCs has been\nused to purchase equipment notes issued by American in two series:\nSeries A equipment notes in the amount of $948 million bearing\ninterest at 3.375% per annum and Series B equipment notes in\nthe amount of $266 million bearing interest at 3.70% per\nannum. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are\npayable semi-annually in May and November of each year, beginning\nin November 2015. The final payments on the Series A and Series B\nequipment notes will be due in May 2027 and May 2023, respectively.\nThese equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2015 EETC\nAircraft.\n2015-2 EETCs In September 2015, American created three\npass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion\naggregate face amount of Series 2015-2 Class AA, Class A and\nClass B EETCs (the 2015-2 EETCs) in connection with the financing\nof 21 aircraft owned by American (the 2015-2 EETC Aircraft). As of September 30, 2015, the entire $1.1\nbillion of the proceeds from the sale of the 2015-2 EETCs has been\nused to purchase equipment notes issued by American in three\nseries: Series AA equipment notes in the amount of $583 million\nbearing interest at 3.60% per annum, Series A equipment notes\nin the amount of $239 million bearing interest at 4.00% per\nannum and Series B equipment notes in the amount of $239 million\nbearing interest at 4.40% per annum. Interest and principal\npayments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in March\nand September of each year, with interest payments beginning in\nMarch 2016 and principal payments beginning in September 2016. The\nfinal payments on the Series AA and Series A equipment notes will\nbe in September 2027 and the final payments on the Series B\nequipment notes will be in September 2023. These equipment notes\nare secured by liens on the 2015-2 EETC Aircraft. AAdvantage Loan Effective January 2, 2015, American exercised\nits loan repayment right with respect to the full value of the\noutstanding balance of the AAdvantage Loan with Citibank for $400\nmillion. In connection with the repayment, in the first quarter of\n2015, American recognized an early debt extinguishment gain of\napproximately $17 million. Obligations Associated with Special Facility\nRevenue Bonds In December 2014, American acquired approximately\n$112 million aggregate principal amount of special facility revenue\nbonds related to the Tulsa International Airport, when such bonds\nwere mandatorily tendered to American. The acquisition of these\nbonds resulted in an $11 million reduction of debt on\nAmerican’s consolidated balance sheet and a $50 million\nreduction of a long-term operating lease obligation included in\nother long-term liabilities on American’s consolidated\nbalance sheet as of December 31, 2014. American exercised its\noption to remarket approximately $104 million of these bonds in May\n2015. The remarketed bonds bear interest at 5.0% per annum\nfrom the date of initial issuance and delivery of the bonds on\nMay 27, 2015, until the day preceding June 1, 2025, on\nwhich date the bonds will be subject to mandatory tender for\npurchase by American. In connection with the remarketing of these\nspecial facility revenue bonds, American received cash proceeds of\n$112 million and recognized a total obligation of $62 million. Of\nthat total obligation, $11 million is reflected as a capital lease\nand $51 million is reflected in other long-term liabilities on\nAmerican’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2015. In June 2015, American exercised its right to\nadjust the interest rate on approximately $365 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of special facility revenue bonds related to the\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport, which were bearing interest\nat 8.50% per annum. In August 2015, these bonds were purchased\nby American and subsequently remarketed. The remarketed bonds bear\ninterest at 2.00% per annum from the date of initial issuance\nand delivery of the bonds in August 2015, until August 2016, when\nthe bonds will be subject to mandatory tender for purchase by\nAmerican. In connection with this transaction, American recorded a\nspecial nonoperating charge of $20 million related primarily to\nnon-cash write offs of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance\ncosts. The $365 million obligation is reflected in current\nmaturities of long-term debt on American’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. Other Aircraft Financing\nTransactions In the first nine months of 2015, American prepaid\n$72 million principal amount of outstanding debt secured by certain\naircraft. In the first nine months of 2015, American entered\ninto loan agreements to borrow $902 million in connection with the\nfinancing of certain aircraft. The notes mature in 2023 through\n2027 and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus an applicable\nmargin.",

Income Taxes At December 31, 2014, the Company had\napproximately $10.1 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce\nfuture federal taxable income, substantially all of which are\nexpected to be available for use in 2015. The federal NOL\nCarryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. These NOL\nCarryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $867 million\nrelated to the implementation of share-based compensation\naccounting guidance that will be recorded in equity when realized.\nThe Company also had approximately $4.6 billion of NOL\nCarryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at\nDecember 31, 2014, which will expire in years 2015 through\n2034 if unused. The Company’s ability to deduct its NOL\nCarryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes\ncan be substantially constrained under the general annual\nlimitation rules of Section 382 where an “ownership\nchange” has occurred. The Company experienced an ownership\nchange in connection with its emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases,\nand US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection\nwith the Merger. As a result of the Merger, US Airways Group is now\nincluded in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax\nreturn. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a\ndebtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership\nchange occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. The Company elected\nto be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax\npurposes that permit approximately $9.0 billion of its federal NOL\nCarryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382\nannual limitation rules. Substantially all of the Company’s\nremaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways\nGroup) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however,\nthe Company’s ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is\nnot anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such\nlimitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax\npurposes. The Company’s ability to utilize any new NOL\nCarryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected\nby the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless\nanother ownership change occurs. At December 31, 2014, the Company had an\nAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforward of approximately\n$341 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is\navailable for an indefinite period. The Company’s net\ndeferred tax assets, which include the NOL Carryforwards, are\nsubject to a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2014,\nthe federal and state valuation allowances were $4.5 billion and\n$264 million, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, utilization of\nthe NOL Carryforwards after December 9, 2013 will result in a\ncorresponding decrease in the valuation allowance and offset the\nCompany’s tax provision dollar for dollar. The Company provides a valuation allowance for\ndeferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some\nportion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon\nthe generation of future taxable income. The Company considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence and makes certain\nassumptions in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax\nassets. Many factors are considered which impact the\nCompany’s projections of future sustained profitability\nincluding risks associated with merger integration as well as other\nconditions which are beyond the Company’s control, such as\nthe health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices\nand travel demand. The Company has concluded as of\nSeptember 30, 2015, that the valuation allowance was still\nneeded on its deferred tax assets based on the weight of the\nfactors described above. However, if for the remainder of 2015,\nprojections for future sustained profitability continue and\nadditional merger integration milestones are completed, the\nCompany anticipates that it may reverse substantially all of its\nvaluation allowance as early as the end of 2015. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2015, the Company recorded a special $6 million\nand $22 million, respectively, non-cash deferred income tax\nprovision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. In\naddition, for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2015, the Company recorded $10 million and $20 million,\nrespectively, of state and international income tax expense related\nto certain states and other jurisdictions where NOLs were limited\nor unavailable to be used. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2014, the Company recorded a special $8 million\nand $22 million, respectively, non-cash deferred income tax\nprovision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. In\naddition, for the 2014 nine month period, the Company recorded a\nspecial $330 million non-cash tax provision related to the\nsettlement of fuel hedges discussed below and $8 million of tax\nexpense principally related to certain states and other\njurisdictions where NOLs were limited or unavailable to be\nused.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the Company sold\nits portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to\nsettle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this\nsale, the Company recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330\nmillion in the statement of operations for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision\nwhich was recorded in OCI, a subset of stockholders’ equity,\nprincipally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect\nassociated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a\nnet increase in the fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging\ncontracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company retained the $330\nmillion tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or\nterminated.",

The shares provided for under the Plan were\ndetermined based upon a Disputed Claims Reserve amount of claims of\napproximately $755 million, representing the maximum amount of\nadditional distributions to subsequently allowed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims under the Plan. As of December 31, 2014, the\nDisputed Claims Reserve held 26.8 million shares of AAG Common\nStock pending distribution of those shares in accordance with the\nPlan. On February 10, 2015, approximately 0.8 million\nshares of AAG Common Stock held in the Disputed Claims Reserve were\ndistributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims, to\nholders of certain labor-related deemed claims, and to holders of\ncertain non-management, non-union employee deemed claims as\nspecified in the Plan, and the Company repurchased less than\n0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock for an aggregate of $4\nmillion from the Disputed Claims Reserve at the then-prevailing\nmarket price in order to fund cash tax obligations resulting from\nthis distribution. On July 14, 2015, approximately\n0.6 million shares of AAG Common Stock held in the Disputed\nClaims Reserve were distributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims, to holders of certain labor-related deemed\nclaims, and to holders of certain non-management, non-union\nemployee deemed claims as specified in the Plan, and the Company\nrepurchased less than 0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock\nfor an aggregate of $2 million from the Disputed Claims Reserve at\nthe then-prevailing market price in order to fund cash tax\nobligations resulting from this distribution. As of\nSeptember 30, 2015, there were approximately 25.3 million\nshares of AAG Common Stock remaining in the Disputed Claims\nReserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will\nreceive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on\nthe same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about\nthe Effective Date. However, the Company is not required to\ndistribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the\nPlan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not\nsufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To\nthe extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed\nupon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will\nnot be returned to the Company but rather will be distributed to\nformer AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date. However,\nresolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on\nrecoveries by holders of additional allowed Single-Dip Unsecured\nClaims under the Plan and the amount of additional share\ndistributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as\nthe total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain\navailable for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is\nlimited pursuant to the Plan. There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an\nadversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to\nseek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee\nbenefits (OPEB) are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or\nterminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014,\nthe Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary\njudgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding\nthat their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The\nsummary judgment motion was denied with respect to all other\nretirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the\nmerits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are\nvested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief\nfrom obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. The\nCompany’s financial statements presently reflect these\nretirement programs without giving effect to any modification or\ntermination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based\nupon the outcome of this proceeding. Separately, both the\nAssociation of Professional Flight Attendants and Transport Workers\nUnion have filed grievances asserting that American was\n“successful” in its Chapter 11 with respect to matters\nrelated to OPEB and, accordingly, by operation of the underlying\ncollective bargaining agreements, American’s prior\ncontributions to certain OPEB prefunding trusts attributable to\nactive employees should be returned to those active employees.\nThese amounts aggregate approximately $212 million.

Frequent Flyer Program In\nthe first quarter of 2015, the US Airways Dividend Miles frequent\nflyer program was merged into American’s AAdvantage program.\nAccordingly, as of March 31, 2015, the related frequent flyer\ndeferred revenue and incremental cost liability for the Dividend\nMiles program has been transferred to American with a corresponding\nintercompany receivable from US Airways recorded by American. No\ngain or loss was incurred from the transaction as the liabilities\nwere transferred at their respective net book values.\nAmerican’s intercompany receivable associated with the\ntransfer of this obligation will be settled by US Airways through\nfuture redemptions by AAdvantage members on US Airways operated\nflights. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2015, $208 million and $430 million, respectively, of total\noperating revenues was allocated from American to US Airways in\nconnection with redemptions by AAdvantage members on US Airways\noperated flights as well as certain marketing services. Allocated Expenses Until American and US Airways are merged into one\nlegal entity, revenue and expenses will continue to be recorded by\neach entity based on either specific identification of the related\ntransaction where applicable or appropriate allocations based on\nmetrics that are systematic and rational. The operating expenses of\nAmerican reflect allocated expenses for certain services shared\nwith US Airways. These allocated expenses include certain selling\nexpenses, certain airport operating expenses at co-located\nairports, information technology expenses and corporate\nmanagement and support functions. Shared selling expenses have been\nallocated primarily based on the passenger revenue of each\nrespective carrier. Shared airport operating expenses have\nbeen allocated based on American’s and US Airways’\nrespective departures at those airports. Shared other expenses\nhave been allocated primarily based on American’s and US\nAirways’ respective available seat miles (ASMs). For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $389 million\nand $808 million of total net operating expenses, respectively, was\nallocated from American to US Airways.

The\naccompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAAG’s principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc.\n(American). All significant intercompany transactions have been\neliminated. On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), AMR\nMerger Sub, Inc. merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US\nAirways Group) (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, a Delaware corporation (formerly\nknown as AMR Corporation or AMR) following the Merger. On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify our\ninternal corporate structure and as part of the integration efforts\nfollowing the business combination of AAG and US Airways Group, AAG\ncaused US Airways Group to be merged with and into AAG, with AAG as\nthe surviving corporation, and, immediately thereafter, US Airways,\nInc. (US Airways), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with\nAmerican as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger of\nUS Airways and American, US Airways transferred all of its assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to American. For\nfinancial reporting purposes, this transaction constituted a\ntransfer of assets between entities under common control and was\naccounted for at historical cost. Management believes that all adjustments necessary\nfor the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally\nrecurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the interim periods\npresented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nmost significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue\nrecognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and\nintangible assets, the loyalty program, as well as pensions,\nretiree medical, and other postretirement benefits.

The\naccompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAAG’s principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc.\n(American). All significant intercompany transactions have been\neliminated. On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), AMR\nMerger Sub, Inc. merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc.

On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify our\ninternal corporate structure and as part of the integration efforts\nfollowing the business combination of AAG and US Airways Group, AAG\ncaused US Airways Group to be merged with and into AAG, with AAG as\nthe surviving corporation, and, immediately thereafter, US Airways,\nInc. (US Airways), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with\nAmerican as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger of\nUS Airways and American, US Airways transferred all of its assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to American. For\nfinancial reporting purposes, this transaction constituted a\ntransfer of assets between entities under common control and was\naccounted for at historical cost. Management believes that all adjustments necessary\nfor the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally\nrecurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the interim periods\npresented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nmost significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue\nrecognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and\nintangible assets, the loyalty program, as well as pensions,\nretiree medical and other postretirement benefits.

These ASUs\napply to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to\ntransfer goods or services. These ASUs are effective for public\nentities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017.

All of the proceeds received from the sale of the\n2016-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by\nAmerican in three series: Series AA equipment notes in the\nprincipal amount of $584 million bearing interest at\n3.575% per annum, Series A equipment notes in the principal\namount of $262 million bearing interest at 4.10% per annum and\nSeries B equipment notes in the principal amount of $228 million\nbearing interest at 5.25% per annum. Interest and principal\npayments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in\nJanuary and July of each year, beginning in July 2016. The final\npayments on the Series AA and Series A equipment notes are due in\nJanuary 2028 and the final payment on the Series B equipment notes\nis due in January 2024. These equipment notes are secured by liens\non the 2016-1 EETC Aircraft.\n2016-2 EETCs In May 2016, American created two pass-through\ntrusts which issued approximately $829 million aggregate face\namount of Series 2016-2 Class AA and Class A EETCs (the 2016-2\nEETCs) in connection with the financing of 22 aircraft owned by\nAmerican or scheduled to be delivered to American in July 2016 and\nAugust 2016 (the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft). Proceeds received from the\nsale of the 2016-2 EETCs were deposited in escrow for the benefit\nof holders of the 2016-2 EETCs until such time as American issues\nequipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase the\nnotes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds\nare not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by\nthe depository are not American’s assets.\nAs of June 30, 2016, $595 million of the\nescrowed proceeds from the 2016-2 EETCs have been used to purchase\nequipment notes issued by American in two series: Series AA\nequipment notes in the amount of $407 million bearing interest at\n3.20% per annum and Series A equipment notes in the amount of\n$188 million bearing interest at 3.65% per annum. Interest and\nprincipal on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in June\nand December of each year, with interest payments beginning in\nDecember 2016 and principal payments beginning in June 2017. The\nfinal payments on the Series AA and Series A equipment notes are\ndue in June 2028. These equipment notes are secured by liens on 14\nof the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft. The remaining $234 million of escrowed\nproceeds will be used to purchase equipment notes as the remaining\neight aircraft are delivered.\n2016 Credit Facilities On April 29, 2016, American and AAG entered\ninto a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the 2016 Credit Agreement),\namong American, as the borrower, AAG as parent and guarantor, and\nBarclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term loan\nfacility (the 2016 Term Loan Facility) and a revolving credit\nfacility that may be established in the future (the 2016 Revolving\nCredit Facility, and together with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the\n2016 Credit Facilities). As of June 30, 2016, $1.0 billion was\noutstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility were\nused to repay approximately $588 million in remaining principal\nplus accrued and unpaid interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit\nFacility Tranche B-2 with the remainder of the proceeds to be used\nfor general corporate purposes. The 2016 Term Loan Facility matures in April 2023,\nunless otherwise extended by the applicable parties, and is\nrepayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the\noriginal principal balance with any unpaid balance due on the\nmaturity date of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. Voluntary prepayments\nmay be made by American at any time, with a premium of 1.0%\napplicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is\nsix months following April 29, 2016. Borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Facility bear\ninterest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at\nAmerican’s option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus\nan applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75%\nfor borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nAgreement are secured by a lien on aircraft spare parts owned by\nAmerican. American has the ability to add or release certain types\nof collateral, subject to certain conditions, at its discretion.\nThe obligations of American under the 2016 Credit Facilities are\nguaranteed by AAG. American is required to periodically appraise the\nvalue of its collateral and calculate the collateral coverage\nratio. If the calculated collateral coverage ratio is below 1.6 to\n1.0, American may be required either to provide additional\ncollateral (which may include cash collateral) to secure its\nobligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement or repay the loans\nunder the 2016 Credit Agreement or certain other indebtedness, in\nsuch amounts that the recalculated collateral coverage ratio, after\ngiving effect to any such additional collateral or repayment, is at\nleast 1.6 to 1.0. The 2016 Credit Facilities contain events of\ndefault customary for similar financings, including cross default\nto other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault, the outstanding obligations under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities may be accelerated and become due and payable\nimmediately. In addition, if a “change of control” (as\ndefined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG,\nAmerican will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay\nat par the loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facilities and\nterminate the 2016 Revolving Facility. The 2016 Credit Facilities\nalso include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to\nmaintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2016\nCredit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the\nability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and\nmake certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens\non the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain\naffiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities,\nin each case subject to certain exceptions.\nObligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue\nBonds In June 2016, the New York Transportation\nDevelopment Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million\nof special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on\nbehalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds\ngenerally were used to provide a portion of the funds to refinance\n$1.0 billion of the existing outstanding special facility revenue\nbonds (Prior JFK Bonds). The net proceeds from the Prior JFK Bonds\npartially financed the construction of a terminal used by American\nat John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) (the Terminal). American is required to pay debt service on the\n2016 JFK Bonds through payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC,\nand American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s\nand AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a\nmortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related\nproperty from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at\napproximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the\nissuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of\nthis amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund\nthe redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The 2016 JFK Bonds bear\ninterest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million\nof serial bonds, portions of which mature annually from\nAugust 1, 2017 to August 1, 2021, and $632 million of\nterm bonds, $278 million of which matures on August 1, 2026\nand $354 million of which matures on August 1, 2031. In\nconnection with the refinancing of the Prior JFK Bonds, American\nrecorded a special nonoperating charge of $36 million consisting of\nnon-cash write offs of unamortized bond discounts and issuance\ncosts as well as payments of redemption premiums and fees.\nOther Aircraft Financing Transactions In the first six months of 2016, American entered\ninto loan agreements to borrow $1.0 billion in connection with the\nfinancing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan\nagreements matures in 2026 through 2028.",

The remaining $234 million of escrowed\nproceeds will be used to purchase equipment notes as the remaining\neight aircraft are delivered.\n2016 Credit Facilities On April 29, 2016, American and AAG entered\ninto a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the 2016 Credit Agreement),\namong American, as the borrower, AAG as parent and guarantor, and\nBarclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term loan\nfacility (the 2016 Term Loan Facility) and a revolving credit\nfacility that may be established in the future (the 2016 Revolving\nCredit Facility, and together with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the\n2016 Credit Facilities). As of June 30, 2016, $1.0 billion was\noutstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility were\nused to repay approximately $588 million in remaining principal\nplus accrued and unpaid interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit\nFacility Tranche B-2 with the remainder of the proceeds to be used\nfor general corporate purposes. The 2016 Term Loan Facility matures in April 2023,\nunless otherwise extended by the applicable parties, and is\nrepayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the\noriginal principal balance with any unpaid balance due on the\nmaturity date of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. Voluntary prepayments\nmay be made by American at any time, with a premium of 1.0%\napplicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is\nsix months following April 29, 2016. Borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Facility bear\ninterest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at\nAmerican’s option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus\nan applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75%\nfor borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nAgreement are secured by a lien on aircraft spare parts owned by\nAmerican. American has the ability to add or release certain types\nof collateral, subject to certain conditions, at its discretion.\nThe obligations of American under the 2016 Credit Facilities are\nguaranteed by AAG. American is required to periodically appraise the\nvalue of its collateral and calculate the collateral coverage\nratio. If the calculated collateral coverage ratio is below 1.6 to\n1.0, American may be required either to provide additional\ncollateral (which may include cash collateral) to secure its\nobligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement or repay the loans\nunder the 2016 Credit Agreement or certain other indebtedness, in\nsuch amounts that the recalculated collateral coverage ratio, after\ngiving effect to any such additional collateral or repayment, is at\nleast 1.6 to 1.0. The 2016 Credit Facilities contain events of\ndefault customary for similar financings, including cross default\nto other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault, the outstanding obligations under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities may be accelerated and become due and payable\nimmediately. In addition, if a “change of control” (as\ndefined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG,\nAmerican will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay\nat par the loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facilities and\nterminate the 2016 Revolving Facility. The 2016 Credit Facilities\nalso include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to\nmaintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2016\nCredit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the\nability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and\nmake certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens\non the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain\naffiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities,\nin each case subject to certain exceptions.\nObligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue\nBonds In June 2016, the New York Transportation\nDevelopment Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million\nof special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on\nbehalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds\ngenerally were used to provide a portion of the funds to refinance\n$1.0 billion of the existing outstanding special facility revenue\nbonds (Prior JFK Bonds). The net proceeds from the Prior JFK Bonds\npartially financed the construction of a terminal used by American\nat John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) (the Terminal). American is required to pay debt service on the\n2016 JFK Bonds through payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC,\nand American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s\nand AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a\nmortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related\nproperty from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at\napproximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the\nissuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of\nthis amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund\nthe redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The 2016 JFK Bonds bear\ninterest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million\nof serial bonds, portions of which mature annually from\nAugust 1, 2017 to August 1, 2021, and $632 million of\nterm bonds, $278 million of which matures on August 1, 2026\nand $354 million of which matures on August 1, 2031. In\nconnection with the refinancing of the Prior JFK Bonds, American\nrecorded a special nonoperating charge of $36 million consisting of\nnon-cash write offs of unamortized bond discounts and issuance\ncosts as well as payments of redemption premiums and fees.\nOther Aircraft Financing Transactions In the first six months of 2016, American entered\ninto loan agreements to borrow $1.0 billion in connection with the\nfinancing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan\nagreements matures in 2026 through 2028.",

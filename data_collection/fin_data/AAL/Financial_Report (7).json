Emergence from Chapter 11 and Merger with US Airways\nGroup\nChapter 11 Reorganization On November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR\nCorporation (AMR, renamed American Airlines Group Inc., upon the\nclosing of the Merger), its principal subsidiary, American, and\ncertain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic\nsubsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions\nfor relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United\nStates Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States\nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the\nBankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court\nentered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming\nthe Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as\namended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, the Debtors consummated\ntheir reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the\ntransactions contemplated by an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as\namended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013,\nby and among AMR, Merger Sub and US Airways Group, pursuant to\nwhich Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US\nAirways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company\nfollowing the Merger. From the Petition Date through the Effective Date,\npursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and\norders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or\notherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition\nDate as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors\ngenerally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to\nenforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the\nPetition Date generally have been permanently enjoined. Any\nunresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims\nreconciliation process under the supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition\nliabilities may proceed in courts other than the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained\nrelief from the permanent injunction. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, trading in\nAMR’s common stock and certain debt securities on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) was suspended on January 5, 2012,\nand AMR’s common stock and such debt securities were delisted\nby the SEC from the NYSE on January 30, 2012. On\nJanuary 5, 2012, AMR’s common stock began trading under\nthe symbol “AAMRQ” (CUSIP 001765106) on the OTCQB\nmarketplace, operated by OTC Markets Group. Pursuant to the Plan,\non the Effective Date (i) all existing shares of AAG’s\nold common stock formerly traded under the symbol\n“AAMRQ” were canceled and (ii) the Company was\nauthorized to issue up to approximately 544 million shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AAG (AAG Common Stock)\nby operation of the Plan (excluding shares of AAG Common Stock\nissuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). On the Effective Date,\nthe AAG Common Stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market\nunder the symbol “AAL,” and AAMRQ ceased trading on the\nOTCQB marketplace. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, AAG issued\napproximately 53 million shares of AAG Common Stock to\nAMR’s old equity holders and certain of the Debtors’\nemployees, and issued 168 million shares of AAG Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the AAG\nSeries A Preferred Stock), which was mandatorily convertible into\nnew AAG Common Stock during the 120-day period after the Effective\nDate, to certain creditors and employees of the Debtors (including\nshares deposited in the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the\nPlan)). In accordance with the terms of the Plan, former holders of\nAMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol\n“AAMRQ”) received, for each share of AMR common stock,\nan initial distribution of approximately 0.0665 shares of the AAG\nCommon Stock as of the Effective Date. Following the Effective\nDate, former holders of AMR common stock and those deemed to be\ntreated as such in connection with the elections made pursuant to\nthe Plan have received through December 31, 2014, additional\naggregate distributions of shares of AAG Common Stock of\napproximately 0.6776 shares of AAG Common Stock for each share of\nAMR common stock previously held, and may continue to receive\nadditional distributions. As of the Effective Date, the adjusted\ntotal Double-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan)\nwere approximately $2.5 billion and the Allowed Single-Dip General\nUnsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.5\nbillion. The Disputed Claims Reserve established under the\nPlan initially was issued 30.4 million shares, which shares\nare reserved for distributions to holders of disputed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims (Single-Dip Equity Obligations) whose claims\nultimately become allowed as well as to certain AMR labor groups\nand employees who received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed\npercentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured\nclaimholders. As of December 31, 2014, the Disputed Claims\nReserve held 26.8 million shares of AAG Common Stock pending\ndistribution of those shares in accordance with the Plan. On\nFebruary 10, 2015, approximately 0.8 million shares of\nAAG Common Stock held in the Disputed Claims Reserve were\ndistributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims, to\nholders of certain labor-related deemed claims, and to holders of\ncertain non-management, non-union employee deemed claims as\nspecified in the Plan, and the Company repurchased less than\n0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock for an aggregate of $4\nmillion from the Disputed Claims Reserve at the then-prevailing\nmarket price in order to fund cash tax obligations resulting from\nthis distribution. As of June 30, 2015, there were\napproximately 26.0 million shares of AAG Common Stock\nremaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. On July 14, 2015,\napproximately 0.6 million shares of AAG Common Stock held in\nthe Disputed Claims Reserve were distributed to holders of allowed\nSingle-Dip Unsecured Claims, to holders of certain labor-related\ndeemed claims, and to holders of certain non-management, non-union\nemployee deemed claims as specified in the Plan, and the Company\nrepurchased 0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock for an\naggregate of $2 million from the Disputed Claims Reserve at the\nthen-prevailing market price in order to fund cash tax obligations\nresulting from this distribution. As disputed claims are resolved,\nthe claimants will receive distributions of shares from the\nDisputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions\nhad been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that\nany of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of\nall remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to\nthe Company but rather will be distributed to former AMR\nshareholders as of the Effective Date. The Company is not required\nto distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by\nthe Plan. Several parties have filed appeals seeking\nreconsideration of the Confirmation Order. See Note 13 for more\ninformation. The reconciliation process with respect to the\nremaining claims is expected to take considerable time. The\nCompany’s estimate of the amounts of disputed claims that\nwill ultimately become allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims are\nincluded in bankruptcy settlement obligations on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nJune 30, 2015. As these claims are resolved, or where better\ninformation becomes available and is evaluated, the Company will\nmake adjustments to the liabilities recorded on its condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as appropriate. Any such\nadjustments could be material to the Company’s financial\nposition or results of operations in any given period.\nMerger Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and consistent\nwith the Plan, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per\nshare, of US Airways Group (the US Airways Group Common Stock) was\nconverted into the right to receive one share of AAG Common Stock.\nThe aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable in the\nMerger to holders of US Airways Group equity instruments (including\nstockholders, holders of convertible notes, optionees, and holders\nof restricted stock units (RSUs)) represented 28% of the diluted\nequity ownership of AAG. The remaining 72% diluted equity ownership\nin AAG (up to approximately 544 million shares) was or is\ndistributable, pursuant to the Plan, to stakeholders, labor unions,\ncertain employees of AMR and the other Debtors, and former holders\nof AMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol\n“AAMRQ”) such that the aggregate number of shares of\nAAG Common Stock issuable under the Plan will not exceed 72% of the\ndiluted equity ownership of AAG as of the time of the Merger.\nAvailability and Utilization of Net Operating\nLosses Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Debtors\nexperienced an “ownership change” as defined in\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(Section 382), which could potentially limit the ability to utilize\ncertain tax attributes including the Debtors’ substantial net\noperating losses (NOLs). The general limitation rules for a debtor\nin a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change\noccurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. The Debtors elected to be\ncovered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes\nthat permit approximately $9.0 billion of the federal NOL\nCarryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual\nlimitation generally imposed by Section 382. Moreover, an ownership change subsequent to the\nDebtors’ emergence from bankruptcy may further limit or\neffectively eliminate the ability to utilize the Debtors’ NOL\nCarryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a\npotential adverse effect on the Debtors’ ability to utilize\nthe NOL Carryforwards, AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation\ncontains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial\nshareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions\nis to prevent an ownership change from occurring, there can be no\nassurance that an ownership change will not occur even with these\ntransfer restrictions. A copy of AAG’s Certificate of\nIncorporation was attached as Exhibit 3.1 to a Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on December 9,\n2013.",

To reduce the risk of a\npotential adverse effect on American’s ability to utilize the\nNOL Carryforwards, AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation\ncontains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial\nshareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions\nis to prevent an ownership change from occurring, there can be no\nassurance that an ownership change will not occur even with these\ntransfer restrictions. A copy of AAG’s Certificate of\nIncorporation was attached as Exhibit 3.1 to a Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed by AAG with the SEC on December 9, 2013.",

These escrowed\nfunds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt\non the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet because\nthe proceeds held by the depository are not American’s\nassets.\nAs of June 30, 2015, $1.0 billion of the\nescrowed proceeds from the 2015-1 EETCs have been used to purchase\nequipment notes issued by American in two series: Series A\nequipment notes in the amount of $796 million bearing interest at\n3.375% per annum and Series B equipment notes in the amount of\n$223 million bearing interest at 3.70% per annum. Interest and\nprincipal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually\nin May and November of each year, beginning in November 2015. The\nfinal payments on the Series A and Series B equipment notes will be\ndue in May 2027 and May 2023, respectively. These equipment notes\nare secured by liens on 19 of the 2015 EETC Aircraft. The remaining\n$195 million of escrowed proceeds will be used to purchase\nequipment notes as the remaining nine new aircraft are\ndelivered.\n4.625% Senior Notes In March 2015, the Company issued $500 million\naggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2020 (the\n4.625% senior notes). These notes bear interest at a rate of\n4.625% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on\neach March 1 and September 1, beginning on\nSeptember 1, 2015. The 4.625% senior notes mature on\nMarch 1, 2020 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\nAmerican, US Airways Group and US Airways, Inc. (US Airways). The\n4.625% senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the\nCompany. The indenture for the 4.625% senior notes contains\ncovenants and events of default generally customary for similar\nfinancings. In addition, if the Company experiences specific kinds\nof changes of control, the Company must offer to repurchase the\n4.625% senior notes in whole or in part at a repurchase price of\n101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest, if any, to (but not including) the repurchase date. Upon\nthe occurrence of certain events of default, the 4.625% senior\nnotes may be accelerated and become due and payable.\nAAdvantage Loan Effective January 2, 2015, American exercised\nits loan repayment right with respect to the full value of the\noutstanding balance of the AAdvantage Loan with Citibank for $400\nmillion. In connection with the repayment, in the first quarter of\n2015, American recognized an early debt extinguishment gain of\napproximately $17 million.\nObligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue\nBonds In December 2014, American acquired approximately\n$112 million aggregate principal amount of special facility revenue\nbonds related to the Tulsa International Airport, when such bonds\nwere mandatorily tendered to American. The acquisition of these\nbonds resulted in an $11 million reduction of debt on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet and a $50 million\nreduction of a long-term operating lease obligation included in\nother long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheet as of December 31, 2014. American exercised its\noption to remarket approximately $104 million of these bonds in May\n2015. The remarketed bonds will initially bear a coupon interest\nrate of 5% from the date of initial issuance and delivery of the\nbonds on May 27, 2015, until the day preceding June 1,\n2025, on which date the bonds will be subject to mandatory tender.\nIn connection with the remarketing of these special facility\nrevenue bonds, American received cash proceeds of $112 million and\nrecognized a total obligation of $62 million. Of that total\nobligation, $11 million is reflected as a capital lease and $51\nmillion is reflected in other long-term liabilities on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nJune 30, 2015. In June 2015, American exercised its right to\nadjust the interest rate on approximately $365 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of special facility revenue bonds, reflected as\ndebt on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to the John F. Kennedy International Airport. In connection\nwith the adjustment to a new interest rate, the bonds are required\nto be purchased by American on August 3, 2015. American is in\nthe process of remarketing the bonds at the new interest rate. The\nremarketed bonds are expected to be subject to mandatory tender for\npurchase by American on August 1, 2016. As a result, American\nreclassified $365 million to current maturities of long-term debt\non its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,\n2015.\nOther Aircraft Financing Transactions In the first six months of 2015, American prepaid\n$72 million principal amount of outstanding debt secured by certain\naircraft. In the first six months of 2015, the Company\nentered into loan agreements to borrow $465 million in connection\nwith the financing of certain aircraft deliveries. The notes mature\nin 2025 through 2027 and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus an\napplicable margin.",

                "value": "8. Income Taxes At December 31, 2014, the Company had\napproximately $10.1 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce\nfuture federal taxable income, substantially all of which are\nexpected to be available for use in 2015. The federal NOL\nCarryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. These NOL\nCarryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $867 million\nrelated to the implementation of share-based compensation\naccounting guidance that will be recorded in equity when realized.\nThe Company also had approximately $4.6 billion of NOL\nCarryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at\nDecember 31, 2014, which will expire in years 2015 through\n2034 if unused. The Company’s ability to deduct its NOL\nCarryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes\ncan be substantially constrained under the general annual\nlimitation rules of Section 382 where an “ownership\nchange” has occurred. The Company experienced an ownership\nchange in connection with its emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases,\nand US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection\nwith the Merger. As a result of the Merger, US Airways Group is now\nincluded in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax\nreturn. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a\ndebtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership\nchange occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. The Company elected\nto be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax\npurposes that permit approximately $9.0 billion of its federal NOL\nCarryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382\nannual limitation rules. Substantially all of the Company’s\nremaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways\nGroup) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however,\nthe Company’s ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is\nnot anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such\nlimitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax\npurposes. The Company’s ability to utilize any new NOL\nCarryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected\nby the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless\nanother ownership change occurs. At December 31, 2014, the Company had an\nAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforward of approximately\n$341 million available for federal income tax purposes, which\nis available for an indefinite period. The Company’s net\ndeferred tax assets, which include the NOL Carryforwards, are\nsubject to a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2014,\nthe federal and state valuation allowances were $4.5 billion and\n$264 million, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, utilization of\nthe NOL Carryforwards after December 9, 2013 will result in a\ncorresponding decrease in the valuation allowance and offset the\nCompany’s tax provision dollar for dollar. The Company provides a valuation allowance for\ndeferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some\nportion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon\nthe generation of future taxable income. The Company considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence and makes certain\nassumptions. The Company considers many factors in evaluating the\nrealizability of its deferred tax assets including risks associated\nwith merger integration as well as other factors, which continue to\nbe affected by conditions beyond its control, such as the condition\nof the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel\ndemand. The Company has concluded as of June 30, 2015 that the\nvaluation allowance was still needed on its deferred tax asset\nbased on the weight of the factors described above. For the three and six months ended June 30,\n2015, the Company recorded a special $7 million and $16 million,\nrespectively, non-cash deferred income tax provision related to\ncertain indefinite-lived intangible assets. In addition, for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded\n$8 million and $10 million, respectively, of state and\ninternational income tax expense related to certain states and\nother jurisdictions where NOLs were limited or unavailable to be\nused. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company sold\nits portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to\nsettle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this\nsale, the Company recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330\nmillion in the statement of operations for the second quarter of\n2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in\nOCI, a subset of stockholders’ equity, principally in 2009.\nThis provision represents the tax effect associated with gains\nrecorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the\nfair value of the Company’s fuel hedging contracts. In\naccordance with GAAP, the Company retained the $330 million tax\nprovision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated.\nIn addition, the Company recorded a special $7 million non-cash\ndeferred income tax provision related to certain indefinite-lived\nintangible assets in the 2014 second quarter. The 2014 six month\nperiod included the $330 million non-cash tax provision related to\nthe settlement of fuel hedges discussed above as well as a special\n$15 million non-cash deferred income tax provision related to\ncertain indefinite-lived intangible assets.

During 2014, the Company significantly reduced\ncapacity in the Venezuelan market and is no longer accepting\nbolivars as payment for airline tickets. The Company is monitoring\nthis situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of\nVenezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses or other\naccounting adjustments, which could be material, particularly in\nlight of the additional uncertainty posed by the recent changes to\nthe foreign exchange regulations and the continued deterioration of\neconomic conditions in Venezuela.

                "value": "7. Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring\nBasis American utilizes the market approach to measure\nfair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market\napproach uses prices and other relevant information generated by\nmarket transactions involving identical or comparable assets or\nliabilities. American’s short-term investments classified as\nLevel 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for\nvaluation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques\nor inputs occurred during the six months ended June 30,\n2015. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis are summarized below (in millions):\nFair Value Measurements as of June 30, 2015\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nShort-term investments (1), (2)\nMoney market funds $ 207 $ 207 $\n— $\n—\nRepurchase agreements 43\n— 43\n—\nCorporate obligations 2,778\n— 2,778\n—\nBank notes / certificates of deposit / time deposits 2,164\n— 2,164\n—\n5,192 207 4,985\n—\nRestricted cash and short-term investments (1) 641 641\n—\n—\nTotal $ 5,833 $ 848 $ 4,985 $\n—\n(1)\nUnrealized gains or losses on short-term investments and\nrestricted cash and short-term investments are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss at each measurement date.\n(2)\nAll short-term investments are classified as\navailable-for-sale and stated at fair value. In addition, all\nshort-term investments mature in one year or less except for $424\nmillion of corporate obligations and $1.3 billion of bank\nnotes/certificates of deposit/time deposits. There were no Level 1 to Level 2 transfers during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2015.\nVenezuela Cash and Short-term Investments As of June 30, 2015, American had\napproximately $629 million of unrestricted cash and short-term\ninvestments held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance includes\napproximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S.\ndollar and approximately $8 million valued at 12.8 bolivars to the\nU.S. dollar, with the rate depending on the date American submitted\nits repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. These rates\nare materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently\nprevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the\nVenezuelan government’s currency exchange system. During 2014, American significantly reduced\ncapacity in the Venezuelan market and is no longer accepting\nbolivars as payment for airline tickets. American is monitoring\nthis situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of\nVenezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses or other\naccounting adjustments, which could be material, particularly in\nlight of the additional uncertainty posed by the recent changes to\nthe foreign exchange regulations and the continued deterioration of\neconomic conditions in Venezuela. More generally, fluctuations in\nforeign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by\nAmerican and can significantly affect the value of American’s\nassets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well\nas any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent\nrepatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect\nAmerican’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors –\n“ We operate a global business with international\noperations that are subject to economic and political instability\nand have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely\naffected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions\nbeyond our control\nFair Value of Debt The fair value of American’s long-term debt\nwas estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow\nanalyses, based on American’s current estimated incremental\nborrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If\nAmerican’s long-term debt was measured at fair value, it\nwould have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value\nhierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of\nAmerican’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were\nas follows (in millions):\nJune 30, 2015 December 31, 2014\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nLong-term debt, including current maturities $ 11,767 $ 12,050 $ 11,234 $ 11,618",

The shares provided for under the Plan were\ndetermined based upon a Disputed Claims Reserve amount of claims of\napproximately $755 million, representing the maximum amount of\nadditional distributions to subsequently allowed Single-Dip\nUnsecured Claims under the Plan. As of December 31, 2014, the\nDisputed Claims Reserve held 26.8 million shares of AAG Common\nStock pending distribution of those shares in accordance with the\nPlan. On February 10, 2015, approximately 0.8 million\nshares of AAG Common Stock held in the Disputed Claims Reserve were\ndistributed to holders of allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims, to\nholders of certain labor-related deemed claims, and to holders of\ncertain non-management, non-union employee deemed claims as\nspecified in the Plan, and the Company repurchased less than\n0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock for an aggregate of\n$4 million from the Disputed Claims Reserve at the\nthen-prevailing market price in order to fund cash tax obligations\nresulting from this distribution. As of June 30, 2015, there\nwere approximately 26.0 million shares of AAG Common Stock\nremaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. On July 14, 2015,\napproximately 0.6 million shares of AAG Common Stock held in\nthe Disputed Claims Reserve were distributed to holders of allowed\nSingle-Dip Unsecured Claims, to holders of certain labor-related\ndeemed claims, and to holders of certain non-management, non-union\nemployee deemed claims as specified in the Plan, and the Company\nrepurchased less than 0.1 million shares of AAG Common Stock\nfor an aggregate of $2 million from the Disputed Claims Reserve at\nthe then-prevailing market price in order to fund cash tax\nobligations resulting from this distribution. As disputed claims\nare resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares\nfrom the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such\ndistributions had been made on or about the Effective Date.\nHowever, the Company is not required to distribute additional\nshares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the\nshares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay\nany additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of\nthe reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all\nremaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to the\nCompany but rather will be distributed to former AMR shareholders\nas of the Effective Date. However, resolution of disputed claims\ncould have a material effect on recoveries by holders of additional\nallowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims under the Plan and the amount\nof additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former\nAMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock\nthat remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed\nclaims is limited pursuant to the Plan. There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an\nadversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to\nseek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee\nbenefits (OPEB) are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or\nterminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014,\nthe Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary\njudgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding\nthat their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The\nsummary judgment motion was denied with respect to all other\nretirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the\nmerits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are\nvested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief\nfrom obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees.

Accordingly, as of\nMarch 31, 2015, the related frequent flyer deferred revenue\nand incremental cost liability for the Dividend Miles program has\nbeen transferred to American with a corresponding intercompany\nreceivable from US Airways recorded by American. No gain or loss\nwas incurred from the transaction as the liabilities were\ntransferred at their respective net book values.

The operating expenses of\nAmerican reflect allocated expenses for certain services shared\nwith US Airways. These allocated expenses include certain selling\nexpenses, certain airport operating expenses at co-located\nairports, information technology expenses and corporate\nmanagement and support functions. Shared selling expenses have been\nallocated primarily based on the passenger revenue of each\nrespective carrier. Shared airport operating expenses have\nbeen allocated based on American’s and US Airways’\nrespective departures at those airports. Shared other expenses\nhave been allocated primarily based on American’s and US\nAirways’ respective available seat miles (ASMs). For the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2015, $247 million and\n$419 million of total net operating expenses, respectively, was\nallocated from American to US Airways.

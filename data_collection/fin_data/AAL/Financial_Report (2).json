We currently use the incremental cost method to\naccount for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which\nvalues these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental\ncost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard\nwill require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling\nprice approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale\nattributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and\nrecognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The\ncarrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty\nprogram liability is expected to be materially greater under the\nrelative selling price approach than the value attributed to these\nmileage credits under the incremental cost method.

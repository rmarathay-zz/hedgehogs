(we, us, our and similar terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG’s principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We will adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. We are in the process of finalizing how the application of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members. We currently use the incremental cost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. See Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for our preliminary assessment of the quantitative impacts of the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect we will adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. Statement of Cash Flows In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect we will adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2018. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost (income). Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10).\" ASU 2016-01 makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10, including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and it requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. Based on our portfolio of investments as of September 30, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.",

ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. American expects to adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2018. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on American’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components of American’s net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 6 for American’s current components of net periodic benefit cost (income). Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10).\" ASU 2016-01 makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10, including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and it requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. American will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. Based on American's portfolio of investments as of September 30, 2017, it does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.",

A portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-2 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA and A equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-2 EETCs until such time as American issues additional Series AA and A equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which trusts will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not American's assets. As of September 30, 2017, approximately $253 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-2 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on equipment notes issued in connection with the 2017-2 EETCs are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2018 and principal payments beginning in October 2018. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2017-2 EETCs.

                "value": "Legal Proceedings Chapter 11 Cases . On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger. Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of September 30, 2017 , there were approximately 24.5 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. American’s financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this proceeding. DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand . In June 2015, American received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from American, and other airlines have announced that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously. Private Party Antitrust Action . On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On May 12, 2017, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On June 23, 2017, plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants’ motion and cross-motion for summary judgment. Briefing of the parties’ respective motions concluded on September 1, 2017; a hearing date has not yet been set . American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations. DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal Service . In April 2015, the DOJ informed American of an inquiry regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. General . In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within American’s control. Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on American are uncertain but could be material.

Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We will adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. We are in the process of finalizing how the application of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members. We currently use the incremental cost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. See Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for our preliminary assessment of the quantitative impacts of the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect we will adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. Statement of Cash Flows In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect we will adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2018. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost (income).

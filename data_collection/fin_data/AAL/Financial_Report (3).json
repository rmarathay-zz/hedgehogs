On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify our\ninternal corporate structure and as part of the integration efforts\nfollowing the business combination of AAG and US Airways Group, AAG\ncaused US Airways Group to be merged with and into AAG, with AAG as\nthe surviving corporation, and, immediately thereafter, US Airways,\nInc. (US Airways), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with\nAmerican as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger of\nUS Airways and American, US Airways transferred all of its assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to American. For\nfinancial reporting purposes, this transaction constituted a\ntransfer of assets between entities under common control and was\naccounted for at historical cost. Management believes that all adjustments necessary\nfor the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally\nrecurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the interim periods\npresented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nmost significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue\nrecognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and\nintangible assets, the loyalty program, as well as pensions,\nretiree medical and other postretirement benefits.

These ASUs\napply to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to\ntransfer goods or services. These ASUs are effective for public\nentities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before\ninterim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2016.

Interest and principal payments on the equipment\nnotes are payable semi-annually in January and July of each year,\nbeginning in July 2016. The final payments on the Series AA and\nSeries A equipment notes are due in January 2028 and the final\npayment on the Series B equipment notes is due in January 2024.\nThese equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-1 EETC\nAircraft.\n2016-2 EETCs In May and July 2016, American created three\npass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion\naggregate face amount of Series 2016-2 Class AA, Class A and Class\nB EETCs (the 2016-2 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 22\naircraft owned by American (the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft). All of the proceeds received from the sale of the\n2016-2 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by\nAmerican in three series: Series AA equipment notes in the\nprincipal amount of $567 million bearing interest at 3.20% per\nannum, Series A equipment notes in the principal amount of $261\nmillion bearing interest at 3.65% per annum and Series B equipment\nnotes in the principal amount of $227 million bearing interest at\n4.375% per annum. Interest and principal payments on the equipment\nnotes are payable semi-annually in June and December of each year,\nwith interest payments beginning in December 2016 and principal\npayments beginning in June 2017. The final payments on the Series\nAA and Series A equipment notes are due in June 2028 and the final\npayments on the Series B equipment notes are due in June 2024.\nThese equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-2 EETC\nAircraft.\nOther Aircraft Financing Transactions In the first nine months of 2016, American entered\ninto loan agreements to borrow $1.4 billion in connection with the\nfinancing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan\nagreements matures in 2026 through 2028 and bears interest at a\nrate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin. 2016 Other Financing\nActivities\n2016 Credit Facilities On April 29, 2016, American and AAG entered into a\nCredit and Guaranty Agreement (the 2016 Credit Agreement), among\nAmerican, as the borrower, AAG as parent and guarantor, Barclays\nBank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent and certain\nlenders. The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term\nloan facility (the 2016 Term Loan Facility) with a maturity date of\nApril 28, 2023 and a revolving credit facility that may be\nestablished in the future (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and\ntogether with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2016 Credit\nFacilities). As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate outstanding\nprincipal amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $1.0\nbillion. The proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility were\nused to repay approximately $588 million in remaining principal\nplus accrued and unpaid interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit\nFacility Tranche B-2 with the remainder of the proceeds to be used\nfor general corporate purposes. The 2016 Term Loan Facility is repayable in annual\ninstallments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal\nbalance with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the\n2016 Term Loan Facility. Voluntary prepayments may be made by\nAmerican at any time, with a premium of 1.0% applicable to certain\nprepayments made prior to the date that is six months following\nApril 29, 2016. Loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility bear\ninterest at a base rate plus an applicable base rate margin or, at\nAmerican’s option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus\nan applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable base rate margin is\n1.75% and the applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75% for loans under the\n2016 Term Loan Facility. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nAgreement are secured by liens on substantially all aircraft spare\nparts owned by American. American has the ability to add or release\ncertain types of collateral, subject to certain conditions, at its\ndiscretion. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain\na certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the\noutstanding loans under the 2016 Credit Facilities. The 2016 Credit Facilities contain events of\ndefault customary for similar financings, including cross default\nto other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault, the outstanding obligations under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities may be accelerated and become due and payable\nimmediately. In addition, if a “change of control” (as\ndefined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG,\nAmerican will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay\nat par the loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facilities and\nterminate the 2016 Revolving Facility. The 2016 Credit Facilities\nalso include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to\nmaintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2016\nCredit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the\nability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and\nmake certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens\non the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain\naffiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities,\nin each case subject to certain exceptions.\nObligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue\nBonds In June 2016, the New York Transportation\nDevelopment Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million\nof special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on\nbehalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds\ngenerally were used to provide a portion of the funds to refinance\n$1.0 billion of special facility revenue bonds (Prior JFK Bonds),\nthe net proceeds of which partially financed the construction of a\nterminal used by American at John F. Kennedy International Airport\n(JFK) (the Terminal).\nAmerican is required to pay debt service on the\n2016 JFK Bonds through payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC,\nand American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s\nand AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a\nmortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related\nproperty from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at\napproximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the\nissuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of\nthis amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund\nthe redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The 2016 JFK Bonds bear\ninterest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million of\nserial bonds, portions of which mature annually from August 1, 2017\nto August 1, 2021, and $632 million of term bonds, $278 million of\nwhich matures on August 1, 2026 and $354 million of which matures\non August 1, 2031. In connection with the refinancing of the Prior\nJFK Bonds, American recorded a special nonoperating charge of $36\nmillion consisting of non-cash write offs of unamortized bond\ndiscounts and issuance costs as well as payments of redemption\npremiums and fees. 2014 Credit Facilities On September 22, 2016, American and AAG amended the\nAmended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated\nApril 20, 2015 (which amended and restated the Credit and\nGuaranty Agreement dated October 10, 2014), pursuant to which it\nrefinanced the $750 million term loan facility due October 2021\nestablished thereunder (the 2014 Term Loan Facility and, together\nwith the $1.025 billion revolving credit facility established under\nsuch agreement, the 2014 Credit Facilities) to reduce the LIBOR\nmargin from 2.75% to 2.50% and the base rate margin from 1.75% to\n1.50%. The $1.025 billion revolving credit facility under the 2014\nCredit Facilities (the 2014 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged.\nAs of September 30, 2016, $743 million of principal was outstanding\nunder the 2014 Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings or\nletters of credit outstanding under the 2014 Revolving\nFacility.",

Interest and principal payments on the equipment\nnotes are payable semi-annually in January and July of each year,\nbeginning in July 2016. The final payments on the Series AA and\nSeries A equipment notes are due in January 2028 and the final\npayment on the Series B equipment notes is due in January 2024.\nThese equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-1 EETC\nAircraft.\n2016-2 EETCs In May and July 2016, American created three\npass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion\naggregate face amount of Series 2016-2 Class AA, Class A and Class\nB EETCs (the 2016-2 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 22\naircraft owned by American (the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft).

Interest and principal payments on the equipment\nnotes are payable semi-annually in June and December of each year,\nwith interest payments beginning in December 2016 and principal\npayments beginning in June 2017. The final payments on the Series\nAA and Series A equipment notes are due in June 2028 and the final\npayments on the Series B equipment notes are due in June 2024.\nThese equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-2 EETC\nAircraft.\nOther Aircraft Financing Transactions In the first nine months of 2016, American entered\ninto loan agreements to borrow $1.4 billion in connection with the\nfinancing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan\nagreements matures in 2026 through 2028 and bears interest at a\nrate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin. 2016 Other Financing\nActivities\n2016 Credit Facilities On April 29, 2016, American and AAG entered into a\nCredit and Guaranty Agreement (the 2016 Credit Agreement), among\nAmerican, as the borrower, AAG as parent and guarantor, Barclays\nBank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent and certain\nlenders. The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term\nloan facility (the 2016 Term Loan Facility) with a maturity date of\nApril 28, 2023 and a revolving credit facility that may be\nestablished in the future (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and\ntogether with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2016 Credit\nFacilities). As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate outstanding\nprincipal amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $1.0\nbillion. The proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility were\nused to repay approximately $588 million in remaining principal\nplus accrued and unpaid interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit\nFacility Tranche B-2 with the remainder of the proceeds to be used\nfor general corporate purposes. The 2016 Term Loan Facility is repayable in annual\ninstallments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal\nbalance with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the\n2016 Term Loan Facility. Voluntary prepayments may be made by\nAmerican at any time, with a premium of 1.0% applicable to certain\nprepayments made prior to the date that is six months following\nApril 29, 2016. Loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility bear\ninterest at a base rate plus an applicable base rate margin or, at\nAmerican’s option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus\nan applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable base rate margin is\n1.75% and the applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75% for loans under the\n2016 Term Loan Facility. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nAgreement are secured by liens on substantially all aircraft spare\nparts owned by American. American has the ability to add or release\ncertain types of collateral, subject to certain conditions, at its\ndiscretion. The obligations of American under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain\na certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the\noutstanding loans under the 2016 Credit Facilities. The 2016 Credit Facilities contain events of\ndefault customary for similar financings, including cross default\nto other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault, the outstanding obligations under the 2016 Credit\nFacilities may be accelerated and become due and payable\nimmediately. In addition, if a “change of control” (as\ndefined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG,\nAmerican will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay\nat par the loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facilities and\nterminate the 2016 Revolving Facility. The 2016 Credit Facilities\nalso include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to\nmaintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the 2016\nCredit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the\nability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and\nmake certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens\non the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain\naffiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities,\nin each case subject to certain exceptions.\nObligations Associated with Special Facility Revenue\nBonds In June 2016, the New York Transportation\nDevelopment Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million\nof special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on\nbehalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds\ngenerally were used to provide a portion of the funds to refinance\n$1.0 billion of special facility revenue bonds (Prior JFK Bonds),\nthe net proceeds of which partially financed the construction of a\nterminal used by American at John F. Kennedy International Airport\n(JFK) (the Terminal).\nAmerican is required to pay debt service on the\n2016 JFK Bonds through payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC,\nand American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s\nand AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a\nmortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related\nproperty from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at\napproximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the\nissuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of\nthis amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund\nthe redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The 2016 JFK Bonds bear\ninterest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million of\nserial bonds, portions of which mature annually from August 1, 2017\nto August 1, 2021, and $632 million of term bonds, $278 million of\nwhich matures on August 1, 2026 and $354 million of which matures\non August 1, 2031. In connection with the refinancing of the Prior\nJFK Bonds, American recorded a special nonoperating charge of $36\nmillion consisting of non-cash write offs of unamortized bond\ndiscounts and issuance costs as well as payments of redemption\npremiums and fees.\n2014 Credit Facilities On September 22, 2016, American and AAG amended the\nAmended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated\nApril 20, 2015 (which amended and restated the Credit and\nGuaranty Agreement dated October 10, 2014), pursuant to which it\nrefinanced the $750 million term loan facility due October 2021\nestablished thereunder (the 2014 Term Loan Facility and, together\nwith the $1.025 billion revolving credit facility established under\nsuch agreement, the 2014 Credit Facilities) to reduce the LIBOR\nmargin from 2.75% to 2.50% and the base rate margin from 1.75% to\n1.50%. The $1.025 billion revolving credit facility under the 2014\nCredit Facilities (the 2014 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged.\nAs of September 30, 2016, $743 million of principal was outstanding\nunder the 2014 Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings or\nletters of credit outstanding under the 2014 Revolving\nFacility.",

Subsequently, the FASB has issued\nseveral additional ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance on\nprincipal versus agent considerations, identifying performance\nobligations, assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes\nand other similar taxes collected from customers, non-cash\nconsideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at\ntransition. These ASUs apply to all companies that enter into\ncontracts with customers to transfer goods or services. These ASUs\nare effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is\npermitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2016. Entities have the choice to\napply these ASUs either retrospectively to each reporting period\npresented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying these\nstandards at the date of initial application and not adjusting\ncomparative information. We are currently evaluating the\nrequirements of these standards and have not yet determined the\nimpact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic\n842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease\nliability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns\nmany of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with\nthose in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently\nevaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-02 and have not yet\ndetermined its impact on our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation\n– Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee\nShare-Based Payment Accounting.” ASU 2016-09 simplifies the\naccounting for share-based payment award transactions including the\nfinancial statement presentation of excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies, classification of awards as either equity or\nliabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the\nstatement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We early adopted\nthis standard during the second quarter of 2016. The adoption of\nthis standard resulted in the recognition of $418 million of\npreviously unrecognized excess tax benefits in deferred tax assets\nand an increase to retained earnings on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as of the beginning of the current year, and the\nrecognition of $9 million of excess tax benefits to the income tax\nprovision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.",

These ASUs are effective for public\nentities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before\ninterim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2016. Entities have the choice to apply these ASUs either\nretrospectively to each reporting period presented or by\nrecognizing the cumulative effect of applying these standards at\nthe date of initial application and not adjusting comparative\ninformation. American is currently evaluating the requirements of\nthese standards and has not yet determined the impact on its\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\n“Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to\nrecognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance\nsheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new\nlessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. American is currently evaluating the requirements of\nASU 2016-02 and has not yet determined its impact on its condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,\n“Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718):\nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” ASU\n2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award\ntransactions including the financial statement presentation of\nexcess tax benefits and deficiencies, classification of awards as\neither equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and\nclassification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. American early adopted this standard during the\nsecond quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in\nthe recognition of $418 million of previously unrecognized excess\ntax benefits in deferred tax assets and an increase to retained\nearnings on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the\nbeginning of the current year, and the recognition of $9 million of\nexcess tax benefits to the income tax provision for the nine months\nended September 30, 2016.",

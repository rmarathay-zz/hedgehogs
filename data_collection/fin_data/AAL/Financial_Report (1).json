(we, us, our\nand similar terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The\naccompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAAG’s principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc.\n(American). All significant intercompany transactions have been\neliminated. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR\nCorporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US\nAirways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11\n(the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter\n11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On\nDecember 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAG’s internal\ncorporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with\nAmerican as the surviving corporation. Management believes that all adjustments necessary\nfor the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally\nrecurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the interim periods\npresented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nmost significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue\nrecognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and\nintangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for\ndeferred tax assets, as well as pension and retiree medical and\nother postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,\n“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”\nASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve\nfinancial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance\nfor GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nSubsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to\nclarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all\ncompanies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer\ngoods or services and is effective for public entities for interim\nand annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective\nJanuary 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new\nrevenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period\npresented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the\nnew revenue standard at the date of initial application and not\nadjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the\nnew revenue standard using the full retrospective method. We are still in the process of evaluating how the\nadoption of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new\nrevenue standard will materially impact our liability for\noutstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program\nmembers when flying on American. We currently use the incremental\ncost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program\nliability, which values these mileage credits based on the\nestimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.\nThe new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and\napply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each\npassenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will\nbe deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage\nredemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits\nrecognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be\nmaterially greater under the relative selling price approach than\nthe value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental\ncost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to\nreclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are\ncurrently included within other operating revenue.\nLeases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\n“Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to\nrecognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance\nsheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new\nlessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard\nusing a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at\nor commencing after the date of initial application with an option\nto use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating\nhow the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are\non-going and could have a material impact on our implementation.\nCurrently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard\nwill have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance\nsheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for\nas operating leases.\nStatement of Cash Flows In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,\n“Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.”\nASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at\nbeginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of\ncash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.\nASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted\ncash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to\nthe statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied\nretrospectively to each period presented and is effective for\npublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material\nimpact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07,\n“Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):\nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net\nPeriodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires\nan entity to present the service cost component of net benefit cost\nin the income statement line items where it reports compensation\ncost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit\ncost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented.\nThis standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period\npresented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1,\n2018. The new standard will require all components of our net\nperiodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost,\ncurrently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and\nbenefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating\nincome (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no\nimpact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our\ncurrent components of net periodic benefit cost (income).",

The new revenue standard applies to all\ncompanies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer\ngoods or services and is effective for public entities for interim\nand annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective\nJanuary 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new\nrevenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period\npresented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the\nnew revenue standard at the date of initial application and not\nadjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the\nnew revenue standard using the full retrospective method. We are still in the process of evaluating how the\nadoption of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new\nrevenue standard will materially impact our liability for\noutstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program\nmembers when flying on American. We currently use the incremental\ncost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program\nliability, which values these mileage credits based on the\nestimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.\nThe new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and\napply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each\npassenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will\nbe deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage\nredemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits\nrecognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be\nmaterially greater under the relative selling price approach than\nthe value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental\ncost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to\nreclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are\ncurrently included within other operating revenue.\nLeases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\n“Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to\nrecognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance\nsheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new\nlessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard\nusing a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at\nor commencing after the date of initial application with an option\nto use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating\nhow the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are\non-going and could have a material impact on our implementation.\nCurrently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard\nwill have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance\nsheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for\nas operating leases.\nStatement of Cash Flows In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,\n“Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.”\nASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at\nbeginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of\ncash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.\nASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted\ncash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to\nthe statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied\nretrospectively to each period presented and is effective for\npublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption\nis permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material\nimpact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07,\n“Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):\nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net\nPeriodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires\nan entity to present the service cost component of net benefit cost\nin the income statement line items where it reports compensation\ncost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit\ncost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented.\nThis standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period\npresented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1,\n2018. The new standard will require all components of our net\nperiodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost,\ncurrently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and\nbenefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating\nincome (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no\nimpact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our\ncurrent components of net periodic benefit cost (income).",

American is the principal\nwholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG). All\nsignificant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter\n11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
